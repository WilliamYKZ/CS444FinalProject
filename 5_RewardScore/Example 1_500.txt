I'm trying to get the Download Folder to show on my file explorer. However on Android 9, when I use the getexternalstoragedirectory() method, it is showing self and emulated directories only and if I press "emulated" I cannot see more folders—it shows an empty folder. So this is how I'm getting the path: it's working fine in other Android versions but Android 9. Any guide would be appreciated 

``` 
val dir = Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS).absolutePath 
```

Also, I've tried this line of code:

```
val dir = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().absolutePath
```

It doesn't work.

I'd be grateful if you could help me with this.

Thank you.
