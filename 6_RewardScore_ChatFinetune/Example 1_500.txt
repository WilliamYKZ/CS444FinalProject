I'm trying to get the Download Folder to show on my file explorer. However on Android 9, when I use the getexternalstoragedirectory() method, it is showing self and emulated directories only and if I press "emulated" I cannot see more folders—it shows an empty folder. So this is how I'm getting the path: it's working fine in other Android versions but Android 9. Any guide would be appreciated 

``` 
val dir = Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory(Environment.DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS).absolutePath 
```

Please provide steps or code to change the above method (if any) to overcome Android 9 compatibility issues, and the program needs to work fine in all versions. 

It is possible that the download folder shows differently as per versions, and the "emulated" folder may not work for versions like this. Any information on that would also be useful.
