When dealing with `Directory.GetFiles` and `StreamWriter`, the issue lies in how you're using these methods. The key here is correctly utilizing these methods to achieve your desired outcome.\n\nThe `Files.Getfiles` method will provide the file paths which you can use to write to. Your current usage of `StreamWriter` seems to be incorrectly targeting the filenames rather than the filepaths.\n\nYou should be writing to the filepaths rather than the filenames.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```", -2.11328125], ["Question: I have some JavaScript which replaces smiley symbols with their corresponding images in my blog.  \n\nSo symbols like `:)` or `:(` are replaced by proper `<img>` tags. \n\nCurrently there are around 50 smiley symbols that can be used.

This usage will likely be more efficient than multiple separate `replace` calls that may or may not match. The reason is that the `replace` method allows you to perform a single operation that may or may not match, it will allow the browser to perform a single task rather than repeating the task.\n\nThis approach will allow the browser to perform a single task rather than repeating the task.
