When I click the button to \"show modal\" the modal loads however the body of the dialog doesn't fill it's space properly, and the toolbar is mashed up against it. Upon resize everything jumps back into place nicely.\n\nI'm looking for a clean fix, so far I figure a hacky fix might be to load the modal with a zIndex that puts it behind the page body, and alter the z-index via CSS with the button click (but this seems really hackish). I could probably also programatically resize the modal after the button fires modal.show() but that would cause a visible jump in the layout which I would like to avoid.\n\nAny suggestions? I know AlloyUI has tons of hidden goodies, as their documentation is sparse, perhaps the visible attribute is not the one I should be using?\n\nAnswer: ", "1. **Understanding the Issue and Potential Solution**  \nYou are experiencing the issue due to the way you're handling the visibility of the modal. The `visible` attribute is not used in the way you expect it to work. AlloyUI does not provide a direct control over the visibility of the modal through its API, hence the hacky solution you're employing is a workaround that works but is not ideal. A cleaner approach would be to use the provided callbacks or events to control the state of the modal, such as `beforeShow` event, to alter the modal's content or appearance", 3.23046875], ["Question: Could somebody help me complete this linq left outer join query so that the second column of the right table (tempData) is contained in the result set even though it may be null?\n\n```\nsortedData = From cs In mbCustomSort\n             Order By cs(0)\n             Group Join entry In tempData On cs(joinColumn) Equals entry(0) Into Group\n             From last In Group.DefaultIfEmpty _\n             Select New With {.groupField = cs(joinColumn)}\n\n```\n\nAnswer: ", "1\n\nThis answer uses the LINQ `OrderBy` method to sort the data based on a specific column and then uses the LINQ `GroupBy` method to group the data by a column, with the LINQ `GroupBy` `DefaultIfEmpty` method to handle cases where the column is null.\n\nNote that the LINQ `OrderBy` method sorts the data based on a column in the table, and the LINQ `GroupBy` method groups the data by a column, with the LINQ `GroupBy` `DefaultIfEmpty` method to handle cases where the", 0.433349609375], ["Question: I have a dataframe in pandas like:\n\n```\n0                       1                   2\n([0.8898668778942382    0.89533945283595]   0)\n([1.2632564814188714    1.0207660696232244] 0)\n([1.006649166957976     1.1180973832359227] 0)\n([0.9653632916751714    0.8625538463644129] 0)\n([1.038366333873932     0.9091449796555554] 0)\n\n```\n\nAll values are strings.

I found the `applymap` function in pandas, but I don't know how to pass the string as an argument. It seems that there is no direct way to apply a function on a DataFrame where the cells are strings and the only characters are digits using `applymap` in pandas.
