PM says that it was ok some time ago) but recently we started to notice that some frames are blacked-out. We are debugging this issue for few days and we're running out of ideas. We are not sure where the problem is. \nWe now that we send correct images from the device. We noticed that it happens only when the image is different from previous one (but not always... it's easier to observe it on the weaker internet connection). When the image is \"repeated\" (i mean it looks the same but from iPad perspective we create it as new instance) everything is fine.\n\nIn attachment you can find info from Chrome network debugger. As you can see in thumbnails or images are ok. These with Size/Content from cache are ok but there with Size 0 and Content > 0 are ones which gives black screens when we want to draw them on the canvas.\n\nAny idea what we're doing wrong?
