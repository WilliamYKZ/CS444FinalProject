The goal was to swap out values in a string and therefore need to have a two-way map/hash thing.\n\nFor example, let's say you want to change `\\*` to `__asterisk__` (this is just an example, it's not what I'm actually trying to do). You'll have to be able to map `*` to `__asterisk__` (to swap out the value in the original string), but then you'll also be able to map `__asterisk__` to `*` (to get the original string back).\n\nHere's some quick pseudo-code of the kind of thing that you're looking for, so you can understand it better:\n\n```javascript\nvar twoWayMap = new TwoWayMap('*' <---> '__asterisk__' <---> '*');\n\nvar oldString = myString.replace(/\\\\(.)/g, function(m, c) {\n    return twoWayMap.getValue(c);\n}\n```\n\nThis is what I've thought about and tried so far.\n\nThis is what I've thought about and tried so far:\n\n```javascript\nvar myString = 'this is \\* a test';\n\n// ???\nvar twoWayMap = new TwoWayMap('*' <---> '__asterisk__' <---> '*');\n\nvar oldString = myString.replace(/\\\\(.)/g, function(m, c) {\n    return twoWayMap.getValue(c);\n}\n```\n\nThis is what I've thought about and tried so far. \n\nThe obvious problem with this is that the way to get by value is too complicated, and I don't want to have to write out the whole thing every time I have to reverse lookup. \n\nI just wanted to know: Is there any way to solve this problem without resorting to looping through an object? If not, is there any way to make it cleaner or simpler? \n\nAnswer: 1 1\n\nThe answer is yes, there is a cleaner or simpler way to solve this problem without resorting to looping through an object. \n\nOne way to solve this problem is to use a dictionary (or object in other languages) which maps the characters to their replacements. This way, we can directly look up the characters to their replacements.\n\nHere's some quick pseudo-code to illustrate this:\n\n```javascript\nconst twoWayMap = new Map();\ntwoWayMap.set('*','__asterisk__');\ntwoWayMap.set('%','__percent__');\n\nvar oldString = myString.replace(/\\\\(.)|/g, function(m, c){\n    return twoWayMap.getValue(c);\n};\n```\n\nIn this solution, we create a dictionary which maps the characters to their replacements. This allows us to directly look up the characters to their replacements without having to write out the whole thing every time we have to reverse lookup. \n\nTherefore, the obvious problem with this is that the way to get by value is too complex, and I don't want to have to write out the whole thing every time I have to reverse lookup. \n\nIs there any way to make it cleaner or simpler? \n\nAnswer: 1 1\n\nThe answer is indeed that there is a cleaner or simpler way to solve this problem without resorting to looping through an object.

People tend to choose one or the other but I like both. Haproxy is more flexible for load balancing than nginx's simple round robin (even with the upstream-fair patch). But I'd like to keep nginx for redirecting non-https to https among other things right at the point of entry to the cluster.\n\nOn the other hand, nginx is a lot faster for serving static contents and would reduce the load on the powerful apache which loves to eat a lot of RAM!\n\nHere is my planned setup:\n\nLoad balancer: nginx listens on port 80/443 and proxy\\_forwards to haproxy on 8080 on the same server to load balance between the multiple nodes.\n\nNodes: nginx on the node listens to requests coming from haproxy on 8080, if the content is static, serve it. But if it's a backend script (in my case PHP), proxy forward to apache2 on the same node server listenning on a different port number.\n\nTechnically this setup works but my concerns are whether having the requests going through several proxies is going to slow down requests? Most of the requests will be PHP requests as the backends are services (which means groing from nginx -> haproxy -> nginx -> apache).\n\nThoughts?\nCheers\n\nAnswer: ", "\u4f60\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u662f\uff0cnginx\u5728\u76d1\u542c\u7aef\u4f1a\u5feb\u4e9b\uff0cHaproxy\u5728\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u4e0a\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u800cApache\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9759\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u65b9\u9762\u4f1a\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u5176\u5b9e\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f2a\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u6211\u559c\u7231\u4e24\u4e2a\u3002Haproxy\u662f\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u5668\u800c\u4e0d\u662fNginx\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u8f6e\u5b50\uff08\u5373\u4f7fNginx\u7684\u7b80\u8981\uff09\u4f46\u6211\u4f1a\u4fdd\u6301Nginx\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u975eHTTP\u5230HTTP\u7b49\u3002\n\n\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1a\n\nLoad balancer: nginx listens on port 80/433\u548c\u4ee3\u7406_\u5411\u524d\u5230haproxy on 880\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u5404\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\n\n\u8282\u70b9\uff1anginx\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u4f1a\u8bf7\u6c42\u6765\u81eahaproxy\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5185\u5bb9\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\n\n\u56de\u7b54\uff1anginx\u5728\u76d1\u542c\u7aef\u4f1a\u66f4\u5feb\uff0cHaproxy\u5728\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u4e0a\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u800cApache\u5728\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411HTTP\u5230HTTPS\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002\n\nThoughts\nCheers\nAnswer\n\u7b54\u6848:\n\u7b54\u6848:\n\u7b54\u6848\uff1a\n\u7b54\u6848\uff1a\n\nload-balancer: nginx listens on port 80/33 and proxy_forwards to haproxy on 8080 on the same server to load balance between the nodes\n\nAssistant: Load-balancer: nginx listens on port 80/33 and proxy_forwards to haproxy on 880 on the same server to load balance between the nodes\n\nAssistant: Load-balancer: nginx listens on port 80/33 and proxy_forwards to haproxy on 880 on the same server to load balance between the nodes\n\nAssistant: Load-balancer: nginx listens on port 80/33 and proxy_forwards to haproxy on 880 on the same server to load balance between the nodes\n\nAssistant: Load-balancer: nginx listens on port 80/33 and proxy_forwards to haproxy on 880 on the same server to load balance between the nodes\n\nAssistant: Load-balancer: nginx listens on port 80/33 and proxy_forwards to haproxy on 880 on the same server to load balance between the nodes\n\nAssistant: Load-balancer: nginx listens on port 80/33 and proxy_forwards to haproxy on 880 on the same server to load balance between the nodes\n\nAssistant: Load-balancer: nginx listens on port 80/33 and proxyForwards to haproxy on 880 on the same server to load balance between the nodes\n\nAssistant: Load-balancer: nginx listens on port 80/33 and proxyForwards to haproxy on 880 on the same server to load balance between the nodes\n\nAssistant: Load-balancer: nginx listens on port 80/33 and proxyForwards to haproxy on 880 on the same server to load balance between the nodes\n\nAssistant: Load-balancer: nginx listens on port 80/33 and proxyForwards to haproxy on 880 on the same server to load balance between the nodes\n\nAssistant: Load-balancer: nginx listens on port 80/33 and proxyForwards to haproxy on 880 on the same server to load balance between the nodes\n\nAssistant: Load-balancer: nginx listens on port 80/33 and proxyForwards to haproxy on 880 on the same server to load balance between the nodes\n\nAssistant: Load-balancer: nginx listens on port 80/33 and proxyForwards to haproxy on 880 on the same server to load balance between the nodes\n\nAssistant:", -1.123046875], ["Question: I want to know how I can write an Inifile so that I can read from it in order.\n\nFirst of all writing it: Let say I have 2 strings I want to save (Name and Lastname).\n\nThis is a button.
