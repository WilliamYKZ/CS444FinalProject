The issue you're encountering can be related to how the data is being read and processed by R Studio. When you replace `::` with a character, such as `'`, ` '`, or any whitespace, it changes the structure of the text, making it be different from the original data format. This can lead to R Studio detecting the change and therefore interpreting the text differently than expected.\n\nHere are some solutions to fix the issue without using Python:\n\n1. **Use Notepad++ for Replacement**:\n   - Replace `::` with `'` or a whitespace (` ` in Notepad++. This will make the text more readable and allow viewing large files easily.
