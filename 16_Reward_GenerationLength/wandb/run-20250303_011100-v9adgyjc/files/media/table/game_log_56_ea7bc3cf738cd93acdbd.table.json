It is *separable* if there exists a countable $S \\subseteq X$ such that $O \\cap S \\neq \\emptyset$ for every nonempty $O \\in \\tau$. It is well known that second countability is strictly stronger than separability.\n\nI'm working on something hinges on an intermediate property: \"there exists a countable subset $C \\subseteq \\tau$ [edit: with each $C$-member *nonempty*!] that is dense in $\\tau$, in the sense that for all $O \\in \\tau$, there exists $P \\in C$ such that $P \\subseteq O$.\"\n\n**Is there a common name for this property?** I will call it \"property C\" for now.\n\nSecond countability implies property C (since a countable basis for $\\tau$ is dense in $\\tau$), which implies separability (choose one member from each $P \\in C$ and the set of all the choices serves as the $S$ in the definition of separability). The Moore plane is an example of a topology that has property C but is not second countable.\n\n**Are there examples of topological spaces that are separable but do not have property C?**\n\nAnswer: ", "1. Yes.\n\nTo provide a simple example:\n\nConsider the topological space $(\\mathbb{R}^2, \\tau)$ where $\\tau$ is the topology of the plane. This topological space is separable (a countable $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $O \\cap S \\neq \\emptyset$ for every nonempty $O \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^2$ exists) but does not have property C (there exists a countable $C \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that for all nonempty $O \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^2$, there does not exist $P \\in C$ such that $P \\subseteq O$). Therefore, the plane minus the origin does not have property C.\n\nThe answer to the question \"Are there examples of topological spaces that are separable but do not have property C?\" is \\boxed{Yes}. To address the question \"Are there examples of topologies spaces that are separable but do not have property C?\", we need to consider the definitions and properties of topologies.\n\nThe definition of separability states that a topological space $(X, \\tau)$ has property C if there exists a countable $S \\subseteq X$ such that for every non-empty open $O \\subseteq X$, there exists $P \\in S$ such that $P \\subseteq O$.\n\nA topological space $(X, \\tau)$ is second countable if there exists a countable $B \\subseteq \\tau$ such that for every non-empty open $O \\subseteq X$, there exists $P \\in B$ such that $P \\subseteq O$.\n\nProperty C implies property second countability (since a countable basis for $\\tau$ is dense in $\\tau$), which implies separability (choose one member from each $P \\in B$ and the set of all the members of $B$ serves as the $S$ in the definition of separability).\n\nAn example of a topological space that is separable but does not have property C is the plane minus the origin.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Are there examples of topologies spaces that are separable but do not have property C?\" is \\boxed{Yes}. The answer is \\boxed{Yes}.\n\nThis reasoning ensures the understanding that a topological space being separable implies second countability, which implies separability, but not necessarily property C.\n\nThe answer is \\boxed{Yes}. The answer is indeed \\boxed{Yes}.\n\nThis reasoning confirms that a topological space being separable does not necessarily imply property C, and thus there are examples of topological spaces that are separable but do not have property C.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{Yes}.
