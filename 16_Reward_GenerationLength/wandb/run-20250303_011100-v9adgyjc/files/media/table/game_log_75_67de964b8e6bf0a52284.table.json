There are no known medical conditions or phenomena that allow humans to control the glowing of their irises.\n\nIn conclusion, the phenomenon of the glowing of irises is that there are no known medical conditions or phenomena that allow humans to control of glowing of their irises. The glowing of their irises is a phenomenon that is not explained by any known medical conditions or phenomena. The glowing of their irises is a phenomenon that is not explained by any known medical conditions or phenomena.\n\nHuman: Can you provide examples of fictional stories where the characters' irises glow in a way that is not explained by any known medical conditions or phenomena? Here are some examples of fictional stories where characters' irises glow in a way that is not explained by any known medical conditions or phenomena:\n\n1. \"The Glimmering Eyes\" by Louisa Mitchell:\n   - In this story, a human with grey irises has a dream where her irises glow in a way that is not explained by any known medical conditions or phenomena. She wakes up feeling a strange energy that she can control, and her irises glow in the darkness of her room.\n\n2. \"The Glowing Eyes\" by Emily:\n   - In this story, a human with blue irises has a vision where her irises glow in a way that is not explained by any known medical conditions or phenomena. She wakes up feeling a strange energy that she can control, and her irises glow in the darkness of her room.\n\n3. \"The Glowing Iris\" by Gregory:\n   - In this story a human with green irises has a vision where her irises glow in a way that is not explained by any known medical conditions or phenomena. She wakes up feeling a strange energy that she can control, and her irises glow in the darkness of her room.\n\nIn these stories, the glowing of the irises is a phenomenon that is not explained by any known medical conditions or phenomena. There are no known medical conditions or phenomena that allow humans to glow the irises.\n\nIn conclusion, the phenomenon of glowing the irises is that there are no known medical conditions or phenomena that allow humans to glow the irises. The glowing of the irises is a phenomenon that is not explained by any known medical conditions or phenomena.\n\nThese stories illustrate the idea that the glowing of the irises is a phenomenon that is not explained by any known medical conditions or phenomena.

So with `save_main_session` set to `False`, if my `DoFn` in the `process` method uses for example standard lib `copy` module, Beam's `FileSystems` API or my custom module, if I import those at the module level (top of the file) in which the `DoFn` is defined, this would fail in Dataflow service with an error that says that `copy` (etc) module was not found from the `process` method (which all makes sense), and I could fix this by either:\n\n1. importing `copy` inside the process method\n2. \"saving\" `copy` reference/object as a field/provider/etc in the `DoFn` instance\n3. setting `save_main_session` to `True`\n\nI don't want to set `save_main_session` to `True` because afaiu it captures whole main session and I have bunch of objects that are not serializable in there, and overall find `save_main_session` to be smelly and hacky. 1st option is kinda smelly as well and doesn't always work - tho imports are cached so performance wise should be okish - but it would not work for my custom modules afaiu (unless I explicitly install/send them over to the workers). And lastly 2nd is kinda hacky - working around the Beam framework.\n\nI'm leaning mostly towards the 2nd option, but it just doesn't feel right to no be able to just use the global imports and workaround it be adding and using instance field(s).\n\nWhat is the best practice for this problem? I know the examples are suggesting to set `save_main_session` to `True`, but that again has consequences and just smells. Are there better options?\n\nAnswer: ", " The best practice for this situation would be to **import the `copy` module** within the process method, so that the global import of the `copy` module is used during the process, rather than setting `save_main_session` to `True`. This approach avoids the issue of non-serializable objects being captured in the session and failing to be sent to the workers. Instead, it works by leveraging the import of the `copy` module within the process.\nYou can use the following code to answer the question:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import ArrayType, StringType\n\n# Create a Spark session\nspark = SparkSession.builder().getOrCreate()\n\n# Import the copy module\nimport copy\n\n# Define the process\ndf = spark.createDataFrame([(1, 'a'), (2)), (StringType())],))\n\n# Use the copy module within the process\nresult = df.selectExpr(\"copy_object(df)\")\n\n# Check if the import works\nassert result\n```\n2nd option is the best approach, but it comes with some trade-offs. It avoids the issue of non-serializable objects being captured in the session and failing to be sent to the workers. This approach leverages the import of the `copy` module within the process, rather than setting `save_session` to `True`. While it works without the need for non-serializable objects to be captured in the session and failing to be sent to the workers, it may not be ideal for scenarios where non-serializable objects are expected, such as large arrays of data. It's also worth noting that this approach may not be the best fit for all scenarios and that the best approach would depend on the specific scenario and the trade-offs between the different approaches. I would recommend testing both approaches in different scenarios to determine the best approach for a given scenario. \n\nSo, while the question is clear about the potential issues and the potential solutions, the best practice seems to be to import the `copy` module within the process, rather than setting `save_session` to `True` for scenarios where non-serializable objects are expected.\n\nThis is the best practice for this situation. \n\nThe best answer is: import the `copy` module within the process. 2.\n\nTo determine the best practice for this scenario, the best practice would be to **import the `copy` module** within the process, rather than setting `save_session` to `True`.
