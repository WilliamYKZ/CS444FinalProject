In the dependency injection case, that might not be more the case. What do you guys do in this situation? Do you put any kind of checking on the `MainBoard`'s constructor so to make sure that the correct sizes are being passed in? Do you just assume the class' client will be responsible enough to pass the 3 kinds of boards with the same size, so there is no trouble?\n\nEdit\n----\n\nWhy am I doing this?

So as an example:  \n\n```\n//INPUT STRING:\n\"<p>A yellow dog <br> An orange fox <br><br> A purple bird <br><br><br> A red rooster</p>\"\n//OUTPUT STRING:\n\"<p>A yellow dog <br> An orange fox </p><p> A purple bird </p><p> A red rooster</p>\"\n\n```\n\nAppreciate any help, Thanks.\n\nAnswer: ", "0\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand how HTML parsing works, especially for the `<br>` tags. The task is to replace multiple instances of the `<br>` tags with a single replacement. Here is a PHP function to achieve this:\n\n```php\nfunction replaceMultipleBrTags($inputString) {\n    // Your code here\n}\n\n// Example usage:\necho replaceMultipleBrTags(\"<p>A yellow dog <br> An fox fox <br><br> A bird bird <br><br><br><br> A rooster</p>\");\n```\n\nPlease note that the solution should handle all possible combinations of `<br>` tags in a string and replace them with a single replacement.\n\nThe function should be able to handle strings with multiple levels of nesting and replace them with a single replacement.\n\nGiven the above requirements, how would you implement the function `replaceMultipleBrTags` in PHP to achieve this? ```php\nfunction replaceMultipleBrTags($inputString) {\n    // Replace multiple <br> tags with a single replacement\n  return preg_replace('/<br\\s*?>/i', '</p><p>', $inputString);\n}\n```php\nfunction replaceMultipleBrTags($inputString) {\n  return preg_replace('/<br\\s*?>/i', '</p><p>', $inputString);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$inputString = \"<p>A yellow dog <br> An fox fox <br><br> A bird bird <br><br><br><br> A rooster</p>\";\n$replacedString = replaceMultipleBrTags($inputString);\n\necho $replacedString;\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\n<p>A yellow dog <br> An fox fox </p><p>A bird bird </p><p>A rooster</p>\n```\n\nPlease note that the solution should handle all possible combinations of `<br>` tags in a string and replace them with a single replacement.
