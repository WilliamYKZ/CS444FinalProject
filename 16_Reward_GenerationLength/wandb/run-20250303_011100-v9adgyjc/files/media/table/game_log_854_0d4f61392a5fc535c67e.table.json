If you're building a web application where you want to keep the HTML static and perform client-side logic for dynamic content, you can use the strategy you've outlined. Here's a refined version of how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **HTML Files with Empty Place-Holders**:\n   ```html\n   <div id=\"header\"></div>\n   <div id=\"leftSidebar\"></div>\n   <!-- Other static content -->\n   ```\n\n2. **Client-Side Logic**:\n   You can use JavaScript (or jQuery) to replace the placeholders in the HTML files with the dynamic content. This approach keeps the HTML static and leverages client-side logic for dynamic content.\n\nHere's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n### HTML File (index.html)\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n   <title>Page</title>\n   <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"></script>\n   <script>\n   $(document).ready(function() {\n      $.get(\"header.html\", function(html) {\n         $(\"#header\").html(html);\n         // });\n      });\n   </script>\n</head>\n<body>\n   <div id=\"header\"></div>\n   <div id=\"leftSidebar\"></div>\n   <!-- Other static content -->\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis approach keeps the HTML static and leverages client-side logic for dynamic content. This means that each page loads a single HTML file with the dynamic content included in the placeholder elements.\n\nHere's the complete HTML file for `index.html`:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n   <title>Page</title>\n   <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js\"></script>\n   <script>\n   $(document).ready(function() {\n      $.get", 4.69140625], ["Question: I'm playing with my favorite thing, xml (have the decency to kill me please) and the ultimate goal is save it in-house and use the data in a different manner (this is an export from another system).
