I could do this batch by batch but then I would have to run queries which are taking too much time many times again and again. \n\nWhen the simple query is taking so much time I am not able to do any other complex query which needs joins and case statements.\n\nAnswer: ", "2.88 minutes seems quite expected given the scale of the table. The size of the table. For a query `Select * from Table_name limit 0,50000` taking around 2.88 minutes is indeed quite expected. The scale of the table (1.3 billion rows) combined with the size of the table (3.5 GB) is a significant factor in the execution time of such a query. The index length (8.5 GB) is also a significant factor in the execution time of such a query.\n\nHowever, it's still feasible to perform this kind of query in batches and handle the queries that take excessive time. You just need to break down the task into manageable chunks and manage the queries that take too much time effectively. The execution time can be managed by breaking down the task into smaller chunks and managing the queries that take excessive time efficiently. The execution time of the query will be managed by breaking the task into smaller chunks and managing the queries that take excessive time efficiently.\nThis conversation has highlighted the execution time of the query based on the scale and the size of the table.

This is a common issue with different Android versions. Although you have tested your application in your Motorola Moto G phone, where the application runs fine and shows the toast message.

By default, `BrowserRouter` uses the context provided by the browser to manage the history of navigation.

This means that the path management now depends on the context of the application, not on the context of the browser. This causes the path not changing as expected, because the context for managing the history of navigation has changed from the browser's context to the application's context.
