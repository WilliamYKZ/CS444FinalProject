This is used as a blanket statement, as if it is an absolute.\n\nWhile tuning my database to improve performance, I keep coming across this situation that seems to contradict that rule logically for me, and nowhere can I find anyone say or explain in any way otherwise.\n\nIn SQL Server, and I believe/presume most other DBMS, your indexes are created based on specific columns you specify.
