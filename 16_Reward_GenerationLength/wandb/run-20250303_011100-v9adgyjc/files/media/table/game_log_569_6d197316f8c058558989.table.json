I just want to stretch the text vertically so it's kind of deformed. This would be in one div, and then the normal text beside it would be in another div. How can I do this?\n\nAnswer: ", " ```CSS\n.container {\n    position: relative;\n    width: 50%;\n    height: 10%;\n    float: left;\n    display: inline;\n}\n\n.container {\n    position: relative;\n    width: 50%;\n    height: 10%;\n    float: right;\n    display: block}\n```\n\nAssistant: The solution provided stretches the text horizontally, and ensures that the text is displayed beside it is stretched vertically, making it kind of deformed. This approach uses `position: relative`, `width`, `height` for the container, `float: right`, and `display: block` for the text beside it.\nThis answer stretches the text horizontally, and ensures that the text beside it is stretched vertically, making it kind of deformed. Here is the code:\n\n```CSS\n.container {\n    position: relative;\n    width: 50%;\n    height: 10%;\n    float: left;\n    display: inline;\n}\n\n.container {\n    position: relative", -6.28125], ["Question: Let's say I have a Typescript project with the following (latest) packages:\n\n* q@1.5.0\n* typescript@2.5.2\n* @types/q@1.0.5\n\nNow let's say in my project I define a function that returns a Promise (as defined by Typescript's native ambient declarations):\n\n```js\nimport * as q from \"q\";\n\nfunction doSomethingElseAsync(): Promise<number> {\n    return q.Promise<number>((resolve, reject) => {\n        setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 5000);\n    });\n}\n\n```\n\nWhen compiling, Typescript complains with the following error:\n\n```none\nerror TS2322: Type 'Q.Promise<number>' is not assignable to type 'Promise<number>'.\n  Types of property 'then' are incompatible.\n    Type '<U>(onFulfill?: ((value: number) => IWhenable<U>) | undefined, onReject?: ((error: any) => IWhena...' is not assignable to type '<TResult1 = number, TResult2 = never>(onfulfilled?: ((value: number) => TResult1 | PromiseLike<TR...'.\n      Types of parameters 'onFulfill' and 'onfulfilled' are incompatible.\n        Type '((value: number) => TResult1 | PromiseLike<TResult1>) | null | undefined' is not assignable to type '((value: number) => IWhenable<TResult1 | TResult2>) | undefined'.\n          Type 'null' is not assignable to type '((value: number) => IWhenable<TResult1 | TResult2>) | undefined'.\n\n```\n\nFor a while, I thought it was because Q Promises just weren't compatible with Typescript's native declarations.
