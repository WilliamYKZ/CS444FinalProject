So I installed apache on my linux computer and I got it to work. People can access this site by entering my global ip.\n\nNow I would like to add some user dependent content. I want my friends to be able to register, log in and add some information. I know how to make a php login form, how to secure my passwords in my mysql database, I learned about safe use of sessions, ...\n\nThe only problem I have left is the connection between client and server. I'm not going to ask my friends credit card numbers or much other personal information except for a username, password, email (and maybe telephone number). To keep their information secure, I'm told that SSL is the way to go.\n\nSo SSL? Is this really necessary? Any good tutorials on setting up SSL on apache (btw my internet provider prohibits me to use a port below 1023, maybe that's important)? Where should I get a SLL certificate? Can it be a free one?\n\nAnother question: do I need a domain name to set up SSL?

SSL (Security) is definitely not necessary in your case. Since you're not planning to ask for your friends' credit card numbers or other sensitive information, securing their passwords in a MySQL database using PHP and establishing sessions are enough for maintaining the security of your website. \n\nHere are some steps and suggestions for securing your PHP application without the need for SSL:\n\n### 1. Secure Passwords in MySQL Database:\n- Use Prepared Statements in PHP to store passwords in the database. This ensures that the passwords are hashed and stored securely.\n```sql\nINSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('friend1', PASSWORD('password')) // Hash the password\n```\n\n### 2. Secure Sessions:\n- Use Sessions in PHP to maintain sessions. This ensures that the sessions are maintained securely.\n```php\nsession_start();\n// Initialize session\n$friend1 = $_SESSION['username']; // Get the friend's username from the session\n\necho \"Hello, $friend1\";\n\n// Example of session data\n$_SESSION['username'] = 'friend1';\n$_SESSION['email'] =", -5.59375], ["Question: Lots of pieces are tangled here.  \n\nCan you find mate in one?\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8c1Hh.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8c1Hh.png)  \n\nSmall hint to guide you in the right way:\n\n> \n>  If you look at this position as a normal chess puzzle, the answer might be easy.

I need to find a way to determine if the tab is shown because of the result of the rotation itself, or because a user physically clicked the tab.\n\nI've wired up all of the standard events, show and select and they fire regardless of the source of the tab change.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas? Basically I'd like to do something additional if the user clicked the tab, but not if the tab changes by itself via the rotation.\n\nIf I wire up the click even to the tabs themselves it doesn't seem to get fired at all, I'm assuming because the tabs widget is using that event itself.\n\nEdit: here's the basic code\n\n```\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n$(document).ready(function(){\n    $(\"#featured\").tabs(\n        {show: function(e, ui) { console.log(e);} }\n    ).tabs(\"rotate\", 5000, false);\n});\n</script>\n\n```\n\nThe console will show the event (e) whether it is clicked by the user or shown as part of the rotation. Also, the same if I change the event from show: to select:\n\nAnswer: ", " To handle this situation where the event is not being triggered as expected, you can use the `select` event on the tabs widget instead of the `show` event.

This event includes the scenario where the user clicks the tab and also when the tab is selected through the process.\n\nPlease note that the `select` event is triggered after the selection is changed, which means you can include the logic to perform the necessary actions after the tab selection is changed in the context of the user clicking the tab or the process selecting the tab. \n\nThis should help you perform the necessary actions after the tab selection is changed.\n\nIf you still want to perform actions based on the user clicking the tab, you may need to consider the context in which the action is performed, since the `select` event includes the scenario where the user clicks the tab, you can ensure the actions are performed after the tab is selected by the user, but not when the tab is selected through the process.
