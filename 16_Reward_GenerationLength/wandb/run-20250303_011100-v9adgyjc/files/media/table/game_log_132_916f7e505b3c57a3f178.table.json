I am able to divided the question in two questions, one that I will explain below:\n\nIn the following Code:\n\n```\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n$(function() \n{\n   $(\"#accordion\").accordion();\n   $(\"#datepicker\").datepicker();\n   $(\"#button\").click(function() \n   {\n     runEffect();\n     return false;\n   });\n});\n</script>\n\n```\n\nQuestion: If I have this code called in a 1,000 pages, but only 250 pages have a datepicker id. Will the browser spend extra time on the other 750 pages trying to parse for id datepicker, or Jquery has a smart way of solving this situation without affecting performance?\n\nWhat happen if the code is making reference to ids or classes that does not exist on the html markup of the current page, will that impact performance?\n\nAnswer: ", " The answer is that the code referenced to ids or classes that do not exist on the HTML markup of the page will not affect the performance.\n\nThis is because, when the DOM is parsed, the code referenced to ids or classes that do not exist on the HTML markup of the page will not be executed, so the browser will not spend extra time on the pages trying to parse for ids datepicker or jquery, and will perform as expected.\n\nTo elaborate, the question in two questions, one that I will explain below:\n\nIn the following code:\n\n```\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n$(document).ready(function(){\n   $(\"#accordion\").accordion();\n   $(\"#datepicker\").datepicker();\n   $(\"#button\").click(function(){\n     runEffect();\n     return false;\n   });\n});\n</script>\n```\n\nAnswer: The code referenced to ids or classes that do not exist on the HTML markup of the page will not affect the performance.\n\nThis is because, when the DOM is parsed, the code referenced to ids or classes that do not exist on the HTML markup of the page will not be executed, so the browser will not spend extra time on the pages trying to parse for ids datepicker or jquery.\n\nThis is because, the DOM is parsed, the code referenced to ids or classes that do not exist on the HTML markup of the page will not be executed, so the browser will not spend extra time on the pages trying to parse for ids datepicker or jquery, and will perform as expected.\n\nTherefore, the answer", -0.95458984375]]}
