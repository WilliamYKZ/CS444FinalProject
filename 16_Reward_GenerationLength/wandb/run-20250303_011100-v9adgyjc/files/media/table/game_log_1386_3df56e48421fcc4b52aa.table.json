The obvious first solution is $n = 3$, from then on we jump to the solution $n = 2^{3}+1=9$ which also produces a valid solution ($\\frac{2^{9}+1}{9}=57$), from then on it follows that $n=2^{513}+1$ is also a solution, and WolframAlpha is able to verify this.

Your observation and the method of Vieta jumping indeed leads to a solution for the equation \\( \\frac{2^n + 1}{n} = k \\) where \\( k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\).

It also provides a visual representation of the desired behavior through an image reference.\nThe code snippet you provided is incomplete and lacks proper implementation for the described behavior. The code snippet needs to be implemented to achieve the described behavior for the content-box and the slider. The solution will involve the following steps:\n1. Create a slider element and add a content-box with the same color as the slider and hide other elements.\n2. Add a click event handler for the click event of the click on the content-box.\n3. In the event handler, change the display property of the content-box to 'none' and hide other elements.\n\nHere's a possible implementation in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nfunction setupContentBox() {\n  var contentBox = document.querySelector('.content-box');\n  var otherElements = document.querySelectorAll('.other');\n\n  contentBox.style.display = 'none';\n  otherElements.forEach(function(element) {\n    element.style.display = 'none';\n  });\n}\n```\n\nThis solution will iterate over all the other elements, change their display property to 'none', effectively hiding them while the click event handler changes the display property of the content box to 'none'. This is to achieve the described behavior.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the structure of the HTML elements and the CSS styles are as described.
