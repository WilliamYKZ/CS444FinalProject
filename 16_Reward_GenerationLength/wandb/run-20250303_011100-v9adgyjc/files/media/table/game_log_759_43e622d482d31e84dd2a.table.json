In your case, you want to keep the group of franchises with the same name together in the descending order. You can achieve this by ordering the groupings by the sum of revenue, followed by the name of the franchise, and then by the replacement of the name of the franchise.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```\nSELECT REPLACE(vFranMasterNumRollup.FranchiseName, '', '') AS FranchiseName, \nsum(vremittheaderdetailandfran.remd_LaborRevenue),YEAR(vremittheaderdetailandfran.remd_ServiceDate)\nFROM vremittheaderdetailandfran INNER JOIN\n                      vFranMasterNumRollup ON vremittheaderdetailandfran.remh_FranchiseNumber = vFranMasterNumRollup.fran_FranchiseID\nWHERE (vremittheaderdetailandfran.remd_Service BETWEEN @startdate and @enddate AND (vFranMasterNumRollup.fran_Status = N'ACTIVE')\nORDER BY sum(vremittheaderdetailandfran.remd_LaborRevenue), REPLACE(vFranMasterNumRollup.FranchiseName, ''), ''\nGROUP BY vFranMasterNumRollup.MasterFranNumber, \nREPLACE(vFranMasterNumRollup.FranchiseName, '')', \nYEAR(vremittheaderdetailandfran.remd_ServiceDate)\n\nIn this case, you want to keep the group of franchises with the same name together in the descending order.
