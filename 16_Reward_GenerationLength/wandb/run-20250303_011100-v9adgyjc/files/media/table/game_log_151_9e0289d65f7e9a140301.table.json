The `return` statement is expected to return a pointer, but your code is trying to return an integer.\n\nThis happens because in C, the `return` statement is used to return a pointer, but your code is trying to return an integer. You're expected to return a pointer, but you're returning an integer.\n\nTo avoid this, you're expected to return a pointer, but your code is trying to return an integer.
