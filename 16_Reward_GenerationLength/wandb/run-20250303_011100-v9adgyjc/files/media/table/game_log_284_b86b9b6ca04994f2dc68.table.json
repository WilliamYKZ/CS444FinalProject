I want to load one of three different views depending on which of them is pressed. To do so, I thought about passing as an argument the button itself. But I was unable, due to javaFX not recognising the method with the new argument.\n\nHow can I get the `fx:id` of the caller button so I can make the distinction between each of them? Here's what I got this far. I just need to initialize `pressed` variable so it will do its thing.\n\n```\nif (pressed == edgeModify){\n    loader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource(\"/digitalia/view/edgeView.fxml\"));\n} else if (pressed == sectionModify){\n    loader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource(\"/digitalia/view/sectionView.fxml\"));\n} else {\n    loader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource(\"/digitalia/view/LayerView.fxml\"));\n}\n\n```\n\nAnswer: ", "1\n\nThe approach you are taking is to pass the button itself as an argument to the `FXMLLoader`. However, JavaFX does not recognise the method when an object is passed in. Instead, it uses the object passed in as the argument to the method. You can get the `fx:id` of the caller button by passing the button itself as an argument to the `FXMLLoader`, and then accessing the `fx:id` of the button passed in.\n\nThus, to get the `fx:id` of the caller button so you can make the distinction between each of them, you can use the `fx:id` of the passed-in button as the argument to the method.\n\n```\nif (pressed == edgeModify) {\n    loader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource(\"/digitalia/view/edgeView.fxml\")));\n} else if (pressed == sectionModify) {\n    loader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource(\"/digitalia/view/sectionView.fxml\")));\n} else {\n    loader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource(\"/digitalia/view/LayerView.fxml\")));\n```\n\nThis will return the correct view based on the button that is pressed. The `fx:id` of the passed-in button is used as the argument to the method, and JavaFX uses this argument as the argument to the method.\n\n```\n\nThe method `pressed` variable is initialized so it will do its thing.\n\n```Human: \n\nIn human society, laws are a fundamental component.
