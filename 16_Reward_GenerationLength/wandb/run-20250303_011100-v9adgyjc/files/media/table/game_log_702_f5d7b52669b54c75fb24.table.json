The goal is to select all the rows that are related to the rows that have a certain code.\n\nThis can be achieved by using nested queries, where you select from a table based on the values of another table.\n\nThe solution uses the WHERE clause to filter the rows based on the values of a column.\n\nThe answer combines these techniques to achieve the required result.\n```sql\nSELECT t1.trans_id \nFROM transaction AS t1 \nWHERE t1.trans_id IN (SELECT t1.trans_id FROM transaction WHERE t1.code = 'B')\n```\n\nThis is the correct way to solve this problem.

When an element's `display` property is changed from a block format (like `block`) to a non-format (like `none` or vice versa), it affects not just the element itself but its children as well. \n\nIn your case, the `display` property of the `#myButton1` element is being changed to `\"Verstecke Features\"` which makes it `none`. This means that the `div` associated with the `#toggle-div` element is being toggled.\n\nTo toggle multiple divs with the same class via one button, you need to use the `querySelectorAll` method to select all elements with the same class. Then, loop through them and change their `display` property to `\"none\"`. \n\nHere is the corrected code for toggling the divs:\n\n```html\n<script>\nfunction myFunction() {\n  var x = document.querySelectorAll(\"toggle-div\");\n  for (var i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {\n    x[i].style.display = \"none\";\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\nThis way, the div associated with the `#toggle-div` element is being toggled. \n\nHope this helps! If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask. I hope this helps you understand the issue and provides a solution.
