On start up we get presented with an error that says \"High Severity Error - root element missing\" followed by another high severity error that displays \"Log file path must be defined before calling the WriteToLog method\".\n\nAny help with this would be appreciated!\n\nAnswer: ", "1:\n\n:The function should be defined before calling the WriteToLog method.\n\nHere, the root element is missing because the log file path be defined before calling the WriteToLog method.\n\nAny help with this be be appreciated!\n\nAnswer 1: The function should be defined before calling the WriteToLog method follows by another high severity error that displays \"Log file path be defined before calling the WriteToLog method\". \n\nThis is a key issue.\nYou are correct! Defining the function before calling the `WriteToLog` method is a good practice to ensure that any necessary steps are in place before critical operations. \n\nIn this context, defining the function before calling the `WriteToLog` method ensures that the necessary steps (defining the log file path) are completed before critical operations like writing to the log file are performed. This can prevent issues like \"High Severity Error - root element missing\" and \"Log file path be defined before calling WriteLog method\". \n\nThus, to ensure that the function is defined before calling the WriteToLog method, you should define the function before calling the WriteToLog method.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```sql\n# Define the function first\n\nBEGIN{ \n    # Define the log file path\n    write_log_path = '/path/to/logfile'\n\n    # Define the function\n    def write_to_file(file_name):\n        # Open the log file path\n        with open(write_path):\n            # Write to the log file\n        write_to_file('some data')\n```\n\nBy defining the function before calling the `WriteToLog` method, you ensure that the function is defined and the log file path is defined before the log file is written. \n\nAny errors related to the missing root element and log file path not being defined before the log file operation will be resolved by defining the function before calling the `WriteToLog` method. \n\nHope this helps resolve the issue!

Provide more details on the environment and configuration.\n\nAny additional details will be appreciated! Answer 1: Providing the function before calling the WriteToLog method ensures that the function and log file path are defined before the log file operation. This can resolve issues such as \"High Severity Error - root element missing\" and \"Log file path be defined before WriteToLog method\". To ensure the function is defined before calling the WriteToLog method, you should define the function before calling the WriteToLog method.\n\nHere's how you can do it in code:\n\n```sql\n# Define the function first\n\nBEGIN{\n    # Define the function\n    def write_to_file(file_name):\n        # Open the log file path\n        with open(write_path):\n            # Write to the log file\n        write_to_file('some data')\n}\n```\n\nBy defining the function before the `WriteToLog` method, you ensure that the function and log file path are defined before the log file operation. \n\nThis will resolve issues like \"High Severity Error - root element missing\" and \"Log file path be defined before WriteToLog method\".\n\nPlease let me know if the issue still faces.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1.
