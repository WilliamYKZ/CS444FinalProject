I think this is a passive capacitive load, but in the workplace we measured an extension cord and the meter showed it is a purely active load. How does it work?\n\nAnswer: ", "1 - The question you asked is about the type of load of neon lamps, for example, neon probe or wall plug or extension cord with switch and small red lamp. In the workplace, we measured an extension cord and the meter showed it was a purely active load. This means that the load on the extension cord is consuming power. The operation of the load depends on the power source provided.\nThe correct answer is 1.\n\nThis problem involves logical reasoning to understand the behavior of different types of loads based on their measurement results. The key is to analyze the characteristics of the load from its measurements. \n\nThus, the type of load of neon lamps, for example, the neon probe or wall plug or extension cord with switch and small red lamp, in the workplace, we measured an extension cord and the meter showed it as a purely active load.
