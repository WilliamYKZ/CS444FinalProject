The issue with your `AppDelegate` code lies in the way you are trying to set the root view controller. This might be due to incorrect usage of the method. \n\nIn your current implementation, you are creating a new `UIViewController` and then setting a new `UINavigationController` with the `UIViewController`. However, the method may not be correctly implemented. Here is how you can correct it:\n\n```swift\nclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {\n\n    var window: UIWindow?\n\n    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey]) -> Bool) -> Bool {\n\n        window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)\n\n        if let rootVC = UIViewController() { // If the root view controller is not found, this should print \"Root VC not found\" and return `true`.\n\n            print(\"Root VC not found\")\n\n            return true\n\n        }\n\n        let rootNC = UINavigationController(rootViewController: rootVC)\n        window?.rootViewController = rootNC\n\n        window?.makeKeyAndVisible()\n\n        return true\n\n    }\n\n```\n\n###Explanation:\n\nBy using the `makeKeyAndVisible` method, you ensure that the key is made visible which sets the root view controller. \n\nThe corrected code will properly set the root view controller as per your target structure and ignore any issues you were facing.\n\nThis solution addresses the problem by ensuring the correct method is used to set the root view controller. \n\nThe `makeKeyAndVisible` method is called after the root view controller is set which ensures the root view controller is set and visible. \n\nBy ensuring the correct method is used to set the root view controller, the issue is resolved.\n```swift\nclass AppDelegate, UIResponder, UIApplication {\n\n    var window: UIWindow?\n\n    func application(_ application, UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions options: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]) -> Bool] -> Bool {\n\n        window = UIWindow(frame:UIScreen.main.bounds)\n\n        if let rootVC = UIViewController() {\n\n            print(\"Root VC not found\")\n\n            return false\n\n        }\n\n        let rootNC = UINavigationController(rootViewController: rootVC)\n\n        window?.rootViewController = rootNC\n\n        window?.makeKeyAndVisible()\n\n        return true\n\n    }\n\n```\n\nThis resolves the issue by ensuring the correct method is used to set the root view controller and make it visible. \n\nIf the root view controller is not found, the method prints \"Root VC not found\" and returns `false`, thus the root view controller is not set and visible. \n\nThe key here is to ensure the correct method is used to set the root view controller and make it visible. \nThe answer is 1. To resolve the issue, the correct method is being used to set the root view controller and make it visible. The code provided correctly implements the setup of the root view controller. \n\nBy using the `makeKeyAndVisible` method after setting the root view controller, the key is made visible.\n\nThe correct answer is \\boxed{1}. The issue you are facing stems from attempting to set the root view controller using an incorrect method, as the method `makeKeyAndVisible` is not a valid method for setting the root view controller in iOS development. \n\nThe method `makeKeyAndVisible` is used to set the key visible for the root view controller, which is not a valid method for setting the root view controller. \n\nThe correct method to set the root view controller is to use the method `setViewControllers` and then call `makeKeyAndVisible` as shown below:\n\n```swift\nclass AppDelegate, UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {\n\n    var window: UIWindow?\n\n    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions options: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]) -> Bool] -> Bool {\n\n        window = UIWindow(frame:UIScreen.main.bounds)\n\n        if let rootVC = UIViewController() {\n\n            print(\"", -3.2734375], ["Question: I have a method that updates employees data in the database.

(And I want it to be done in pure binary with no conversions and no looping multiplication. Just logic...)\n\nAnswer: ", "100^10 in binary can be calculated using the logic of binary exponentiation. Here's the step-by-step logic:\n\n**Step 1:** Understand Binary Exponentiation.\n\nBinary exponentiation is simply taking the binary number and raising it to the power of the exponent. For example, if we want to calculate 100^10, we are taking the binary number 100 and raising it to the power of the exponent. The binary number 100 is in binary form.\n\n**Step 2:** Convert the binary number to decimal form.\n\nThe binary number 100 is in binary form and we need to convert it to decimal form to perform the exponentiation. We convert the binary number 100 to decimal form by calculating the value of the bits. For example, we calculate the value of the bits of the binary number 100.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate the value of the bits of the binary number 100.\n\nThe binary number 100 can be represented as 110000 in binary form. To calculate the value of bits of the binary number 100, we calculate the value of the bits. For example, we calculate of value of bits of the binary number 100.\n\n**Step 4:** Perform the exponentiation.\n\nOnce we have converted the binary number 100 to decimal form and calculated the value of bits of the binary number 100, we perform the exponentiation. We raise the value of bits of the binary number 100 to the power of the exponent. For example, we raise the value of bits of the binary number 100 to the power of 10. \n\nThis is the logic behind exponenting binary numbers. \n\nThis should be the logic behind exponenting binary numbers. \n\nQuestion: Can you explain the logic behind exponenting binary numbers for the case where I want to calculate 100^10 and I don't know the logic behind it?\n\nAnswer: To explain the logic behind exponenting binary numbers for the case where you want to calculate 100^10 and you don't know the logic behind it, let's break down the logic step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1:** Understand Binary Exponentiation.\nBinary exponentiation is simply taking the binary number and raising it to the power of the exponent.

The binary number 100 is in binary form.\n\n**Step 2:** Convert the binary number to decimal form.\nThe binary number 100 is in binary form and we need to convert it to decimal form to perform the exponentiation. We convert the binary number 100 to decimal form by calculating the value of the bits. For example, we calculate the value of the bits of the binary number 100.\n\n**Step 3:** Calculate", -0.64892578125]]}
