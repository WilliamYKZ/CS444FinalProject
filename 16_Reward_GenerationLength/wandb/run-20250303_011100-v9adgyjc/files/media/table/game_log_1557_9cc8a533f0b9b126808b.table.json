That shouldn't cause an `OutOfMemoryException` in my opinion, but I fixed it anywas of course. And when I did, the exception didn't appear anymore!\n\nSo I removed the check again and studied the exception I got some more. And turns out it had an **InnerException of type `NullReferenceException`** and a stack trace which of course made *a lot* more sense. \n\nBut why did I get an `OutOfMemoryException`?

I've done a heap of searching and reading on the subject but I just can't seem to find an answer/suggestion that addresses this question.\n\nFor example (simple example), if I have a Web API request to withdraw some money from a bank account, I might perform the following validation:\n\n1. Does the bank account exist?\n2. Does the bank account have enough funds to withdraw?\n\nWhen the request comes in, do I save the event before performing the above validation (and risk storing invalid events) or after the validation (and risk something going wrong part-way through the process, like the service going down, and not storing the event at all)? In the case of CQRS, is the event stored before the Command is executed or as part of the Command (in the Command handler)?\n\nI can appreciate some validation would be performed before even making the request (e.g. valid amount to withdraw) but there might be a situation where some validation can't be done before making the request.\n\nThis also leads to working out how I can return an error (e.g. Bank Account is not valid) in the response of the Web API call?\n\nMy understanding of this subject may be all wrong, but as I mentioned before, I'm just learning this subject and I'm hoping someone either has an answer, or can point me to some posts/articles, that will help my understanding.\n\nAnswer: ", "1.
