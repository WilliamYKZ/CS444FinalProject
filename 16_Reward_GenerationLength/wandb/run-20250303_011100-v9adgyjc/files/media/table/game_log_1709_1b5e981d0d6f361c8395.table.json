We have an internal debate whether the API should be as easy as possible to use (in the price of making more calls) or make it as efficient as possible (rendering it harder to use). For example, here are two issues that came up:\n\n* Should we manage session info on the server, or should we pass that info back to the user, and expect him to send it back to us when needed? (Please ignore the security implications of a session)\n* Should we combine calls that are likely to be consequent, in order to save the time spent on the round trip in between, even if they don't really share the same logical functionality?\n\nBasically, the desktop people are in favor of a clear, easy to use API, while the internet people would like to make it as efficient as possible. This is the first public API we're providing, and we need a strategy. \n\nPersonally, I'm in favor of making the API as usable as possible.
