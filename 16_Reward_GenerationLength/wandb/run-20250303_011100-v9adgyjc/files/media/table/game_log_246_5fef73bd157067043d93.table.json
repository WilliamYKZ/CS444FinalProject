The certificate which is passed on to me is same as the one I see when I run \n\n```\nopenssl s_client -showcerts -connect \"<host>:<port>\" </dev/null 2>/dev/null|openssl x509 -outform PEM\n\n```\n2. I used <http://www.ldapsoft.com/> to connect to client's server\nUnless I add the certificate file given to me in *Security > Manage server certificates*, I get a warning saying unknown security certificate\n3. I tried do it manually first in plain ruby (without gem)\nBut i get following error\n\n```\ntest-ssl.rb:23:in `connect': SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed (OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError)\n\n```\n\nCode:\n\n```\ncert_store = OpenSSL::X509::Store.new\ncert_store.add_file \"server-wildcard.crt\"\nio = TCPSocket.new(\"SECURELDAP.MYSITE.EDU\",\"636\")\nctx = OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext.new\n#ctx.cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(File.read(\"server-wildcard.crt\"))\n#ctx.client_ca = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(File.read(\"server-wildcard.crt\"))\n#ctx.ca_file = \"server-wildcard.crt\"\n#ctx.ca_path = \"./\"\nctx.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER | OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT\nctx.cert_store = cert_store\nconn = OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket.new(io, ctx)\nconn.connect\n\n```\n\nAnswer: ", "1 if I am using the correct environment.\n\nNote: To verify the certificate in ruby, I need to use a correct secure server\n\nCode:\n\n```\ncert_store = OpenSSL::X509::new.new\ncert_store = OpenSSL::X59::Certificate.new(file.read(\"server-wildcard.crt\")))\ncert_store = OpenSSL::X99::Certificate.new(file.read(\"server-wildcard.crt\")))\nio = TCPSocket.new(\"SECURELDAP.MYSITE.EDU\",\"366\")\nctx = OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext.new\n#ctx.cert = OpenSSL::X59::Certificate.new(file.read(\"server-wildcard.crt\")))\n#ctx.client_ca = OpenSSL::X99::Certificate.new(file.read(\"server-wildcard.crt\")))\n#ctx.ca_file = \"server-wildcard.crt\"\n#ctx.ca_path = \"./\"\nctx.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER | OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT\nctx.cert_store = cert_store\nconn = OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket.new(io, ctx)\nconn.connect\n\n```\n\nNote:\n\nTo verify the certificate in ruby, you need to use a secure secure server.\n\nCode:\n\n```\nrequire 'openssl'\ncert_store = OpenSSL::X59::new.new\ncert_store = OpenSSL::X99::Certificate.new(file.read(\"server-wildcard.crt\")))\ncert_store = OpenSSL::X99::Certificate.new(file.read(\"server-wildcard.crt\")))\nio = TCPSocket.new(\"SECURELDAP.MYSITE.EDU\",\"666\")\nctx = OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext.new\n#ctx.cert = OpenSSL::X99::Certificate.new(file.read(\"server-wildcard.crt\")))\n#ctx.client_ca = OpenSSL", -0.19140625]]}
