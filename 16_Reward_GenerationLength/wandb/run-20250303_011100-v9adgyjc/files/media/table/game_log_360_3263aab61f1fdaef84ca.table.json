How can I do this?\n\nAnswer: ", "1 Since you're dealing with a console in your multithed application, and you only need to output some output (printf and the like), and so far you don't have any issues, however, you want to support console input as well, and this is where your life gets complicated.\n\nTo forewarn, since you are very unfamiliar with the more nuanced nuances of working with console input and output. Your experience in the subject does not go further than `printf/cout`, `scanf/cin`, and using `SetConsoleTextAttribute()` to change the color (on Windows).\n\nYou would like your program to remain as cross-compatible as possible, but are not opposed to writing platform-specific code, as long as you can find viable alternatives for other platforms.\n\nConceptually, you'd like the console to run on its own thread so that it can lock up while waiting with `cin` without freezing the whole program or one of the other threads.\n\nAny thread could send console output to this thread which would output it in a clean manner (probably using a thread-safe queue), and any input the console reads would send the command off to the appropriate thread.\n\nYour first problem is that while you're typing some input, any output shows up in the middle of what you're typing. To handle this, you can reserve the bottom line of the console for input, and have output go to the second line, pushing the input line down.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <windows.h>\n\nint main() {\n    HANDLE hConsole = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);\n    CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO csbi;\n\n    // Reserve the bottom line for input\n    csbi.dwSize = sizeof(CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO);\n    SetConsoleScreenBufferSize(hConsole, &csbi);\n\n    // Push the input line down\n    csbi.dwCursorPosition = sizeof(CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO);\n    SetConsoleCursorPosition(hConsole, sizeof(CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO));\n\n    // Output the input in a clean manner\n    SetConsoleTextAttribute(hConsole, BACKGROUND_BLUE);\n\n    std::cout << \"Enter some input: \";\n\n    char input[25];\n\n    std::cin.get(input);\n\n    SetConsoleTextAttribute(hConsole, BACKGROUND_RED | FOREGROUND_BLUE);\n\n    std::cout << \"Input received: \" << input;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis approach reserves the bottom line of the console for input, and has output go to the second line, pushing the input line down. Conceptually, this should allow the console to run on its own thread, allowing input to be locked up while waiting with `cin` without freezing the whole program or one of the other threads. \n\nNote that this is a conceptual solution specific to Windows, and other platforms may require different approaches to handle input and output in a similar manner. For example, on Unix-like systems, you might use different functions and mechanisms to achieve similar results.\n```c\n#include <iostream>\n#include <windows.h>\n\nint main() {\n    HANDLE hConsole = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);\n    CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO csbi;\n\n    // Reserve the bottom line for input\n    csbi.dwSize = sizeof(CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO);\n    SetConsoleScreenBufferSize(hConsole, &csbi);\n\n    // Push the input line down\n    csbi.dwCursorPosition = sizeof(CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO);\n    SetConsoleCursorPosition(hConsole, sizeof(CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO));\n\n    // Output the input in a clean manner\n    SetConsoleTextAttribute(hConsole, BACKGROUND_RED | FOREGROUND_BLUE);\n\n    std::cout << \"Enter some input: \";\n\n    char input[50];\n\n    std::cin.get(input);\n\n    SetConsoleTextAttribute(hConsole, BACKGROUND_RED | FOREGROUND_BLUE);\n\n    std::cout << \"Input received: \" << input;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, this approach reserves the bottom line of the console for input, and has output go to the second line, pushing the input line down.

I had something like this in mind but it does not work because of the scope. The issue with using `send` in this context is that it tries to execute the method, which is what you want to avoid. Instead, you should use `send` to dynamically call methods based on attributes. Here's how you can refactor the method to use `send`:\n\n```ruby\nprivate \ndef strip_whitespaces\n  attributes = %w[name description aliases]\n  \n  send(:name) = send(:name).split.join(\" \") if attribute_present?(\"name\")\n  send(:description) = send(:description).split.join(\" \") if attribute_present?(\"description\")\n  send(:aliases) = send(:aliases).split.join(\" \") if attribute_present?(\"aliases\")\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis approach uses Ruby's `send` method to dynamically call methods based on attributes.
