This will match all possible values of the column 'a'. How does this compare to not having the where clause at all.\n\nThe reason I ask this is that I have an application where there are some fields that the user may specify values to search on. In some cases the user would like all the possible results. I am currently using a single query like this:\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM TableName WHERE a LIKE ? AND b LIKE ?\n\n```\n\nThe values of '%' and '%' can be supplied to match all possible values for a and or b. This is convenient since I can use a single named query in my application for this. I wonder what the performance considerations are for this. Does the query optimizer reduce LIKE '%' to simply match all? I realize that because I'm using a named query (prepared statement), that may also affect the answer. I realize the answer is likely database specific. So specifically how would this work in Oracle, MS SQL Server and Derby.\n\nThe alternate approach to this would be to use 3 separate queries based on the user inputting the wildcard.\n\nA is wildcard query:\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM TableName WHERE b LIKE ?\n\n```\n\nB is wildcard query:\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM TableName WHERE a LIKE ?\n\n```\n\nA and B are wildcards:\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM TableName\n\n```\n\nNo wildcards:\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM TableName WHERE a LIKE ?

This approach works for any type because every value in Scala has a `toString` implementation that returns a string representation of the value including its type information.  Note that this assumes that every value in Scala has a `toString` implementation that returns a string representation including its type information. This is true for most types but not all types such as `Unit`. For `Unit` the `toString` implementation returns a string representation of `()`.
