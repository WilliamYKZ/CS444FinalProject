The middle point of the ellipse (where $\\lambda = \\pi/2$) is given by the formula $\\lambda_{\\text{middle}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2}$.6). To determine the middle point of the ellipse with respect to the ellipse (where $\\lambda = \\pi/2$ or $3/2 \\pi$), we need to understand the properties of ellipses and their definitions. In an ellipse, the middle point (where $\\lambda = \\pi/2$ or $3/2 \\pi$) is located at the major axis. The middle point (where $\\lambda = \\pi/2$) is given by the formula $\\lambda_{\\text{middle}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2}.6$. \n\nTo clarify, the middle point (where $\\lambda = \\pi/2$) is given by the formula $\\lambda_{\\text{middle}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2}$.6$. Therefore, the answer (2.481) is valid for any point of the ellipse (for example $\\lambda = 2.481 = 43.33^\\circ$ from perihelion). The answer (2.81) is valid for any point of the ellipse (for example $\\lambda = 2.411 = 43.33^\\circ$ from perihelion).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{2.411}\\). The middle point of the ellipse where \\(\\lambda = \\pi/2\\) is given by the formula \\(\\lambda_{\\text{middle}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2}.6\\). \n\nThis solution adheres to the properties of ellipses and their definitions, ensuring the answer is valid for any point on the ellipse (for example, \\(\\lambda = 2.411 = 43.33^\\circ\\) from perihelion). \n\nThis clarifies the middle point of the ellipse where \\(\\lambda = \\pi/2\\) is given by the formula \\(\\lambda_{\\text{", 0.66650390625], ["Question: I'm looking for an idiom or expression that mean \"**someone is showing a feign reluctance to do/ have something\"** or **\"someone pretends to be less interested in something or someone than they really are.\"**\n\nFor example: \n\n1-Mary claims that he doesn't like issues related to marriage at all, but follows her colleagues' wedding news eagerly.\n\n2- John claims that he doesn't like his classmate,Jane, but it is obvious that he gets jealous of seeing her walking with other boys. \n\n3- Joe asks his GF, Susan, to end their relationship;
