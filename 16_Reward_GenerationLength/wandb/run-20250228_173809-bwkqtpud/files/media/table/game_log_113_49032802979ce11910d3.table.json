When I click the button to \"show modal\" the modal loads however the body of the dialog doesn't fill it's space properly, and the toolbar is mashed up against it. Upon resize everything jumps back into place nicely.\n\nI'm looking for a clean fix, so far I figure a hacky fix might be to load the modal with a zIndex that puts it behind the page body, and alter the z-index via CSS with the button click (but this seems really hackish). I could probably also programatically resize the modal after the button fires modal.show() but that would cause a visible jump in the layout which I would like to avoid.\n\nAny suggestions? I know AlloyUI has tons of hidden goodies, as their documentation is sparse, perhaps the visible attribute is not the one I should be using?\n\nAnswer: ", "1: You're right, the visible attribute is not the one you should be using. Instead, the `zIndex` property is more appropriate for controlling the stacking order of elements in the DOM, which can be used to ensure that the modal appears only after a user clicks the 'show modal' button, and not when the page loads. Since the goal is to achieve a non-jumpy transition on resize, a hackish approach of loading the modal with a high `zIndex` and altering it programmatically with JavaScript on button click might still be the way to go.

No, the best way to do it is to use the `applymap` function with the `lambda` function, which allows to pass a function directly on the cell value. \n\nIn your case, since you want to remove all special characters except the dot and then convert to double, you can use the `applymap` function with a lambda function. \n\nThis function uses the `applymap` function with a lambda function that removes all special characters except the dot and converts the double.
