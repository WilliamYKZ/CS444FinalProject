The first response suggests that as of now, there are no applications that handle local calendar files stored on the SD-card of the phone. You've opened files from the SD-card on your laptop, but there are no applications that handle local files stored on the SD-card of the phone. \n\nAnswer 2 is an attempt to use a local calendar on Android.
