For example, `Foo` has 4 values, `a, b, c, d` that, range from `0 to 3`. Usually I don't care, but sometimes, those structures are \n\n1. used in a tight loop;\n2. their values are read a billion times/s, and that is **the** bottleneck of the program;\n3. the whole program consists of a big array of billions of `Foo`s;\n\nIn that case, I find myself having trouble deciding how to represent `Foo` efficiently. I have basically 4 options:\n\n```\nstruct Foo {\n    int a;\n    int b;\n    int c;\n    int d;\n};\n\nstruct Foo {\n    char a;\n    char b;\n    char c;\n    char d;\n};\n\nstruct Foo {\n    char abcd;\n};\n\nstruct FourFoos {\n    int abcd_abcd_abcd_abcd;\n};\n\n```\n\nThey use 128, 32, 8, 8 bits respectively per `Foo`, ranging from sparse to densely packed. The first example is probably the most linguistic one, but using it would essentially increase by 16 times the size of the program, which doesn't sound quite right. Moreover, most of the memory will be filled with zeroes and not be used at all, which makes me wonder if this isn't a waste. On the other hands, packing them densely brings an additional overhead for of reading them.\n\nWhat is the computationally 'fastest' method for representing small values in a struct?\n\nAnswer: ", " You're correct. The computationally 'fastest' method for representing small values in a struct is to pack them densely. This approach minimizes the overhead associated with storing and accessing these small values, leading to faster computations.\n\nThe key here is that you need to carefully balance between minimizing the overhead", 0.802734375], ["Question: I have an array like this\n\n```\nvar data = [\n    {\n        family: \"Fam A\",\n        category: \"Cat A\",\n        products: [\n            {\n                name: \"Name A1\",\n                style: \"Style A1\"\n            },\n            {\n                name: \"Name A2\",\n                style: \"Style A2\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        family: \"Fam B\",\n        category: \"Cat B\",\n        products: [\n            {\n                name: \"Name B1\",\n                style: \"Style B1\"\n            },\n            {\n                name: \"Name B2\",\n                style: \"Style B2\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]; \n\n```\n\nI want to change the inside objects like below\n\n```\nvar data = [\n    {family:\"Fam A\", category: \"Cat A\", name: \"Name A1\", style:\"Style A1\"},\n    {family:\"Fam A\", category: \"Cat A\", name: \"Name A2\", style:\"Style A2\"},\n    {family:\"Fam B\", category: \"Cat B\", name: \"Name B1\", style:\"Style B1\"},\n    {family:\"Fam B\", category: \"Cat B\", name: \"Name B2\", style:\"Style B2\"}\n]  \n\n```\n\nI've tried using map and forEach that I found in other posts but haven't gotten anything to work.\n\n```\nvar flattened = data.products.map(x => Object.assign(x, { productDetails: data.products }))\n\nfunction getList(data, arrayKey, arrayName) {\n    data[arrayKey].forEach(function(element) {\n        element[arrayName] = data[arrayName];\n    });\n    return data[arrayKey];\n}\n\n```\n\nThe ideal solution would be able to handle dynamic no of nestings but not necessary to move on.\n\nThank you in advance for helping a newer dev!\n\nAnswer: ", "1.
