You could describe the experience of controlling the glowing, as if the irises themselves are lightbulbs - red or purple during moments of high emotion, by your self: This scenario involves the human with grey irises experiencing a moment of high emotion where the iris itself begins to glow with a red or purple light, controlled by the emotional intensity of the emotion being felt. In this situation, the user may find that the glowing is a result of the heightened adrenaline rush. A more detailed and realistic explanation would involve the neurons in the brain firing at high rates during moments of high emotion, leading to a cascade of chemical reactions in the body, resulting in the glowing of the iris. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that control over the glowing would require a level of awareness and understanding of the physical processes involved. \n\nQuestion: My main character has grey irises, and I want to know how I could realistically explain her irises glowing - as if the irises themselves are light bulbs - red or purple during moments of high emotion, and if", 4.46484375], ["Question: I have a question about `save_main_session` and best practices, and please let me know if there is a doc somewhere that covers this question. So with `save_main_session` set to `False`, if my `DoFn` in the `process` method uses for example standard lib `copy` module, Beam's `FileSystems` API or my custom module, if I import those at the module level (top of the file) in which the `DoFn` is defined, this would fail in Dataflow service with an error that says that `copy` (etc) module was not found from the `process` method (which all makes sense), and I could fix this by either:\n\n1. importing `copy` inside the process method\n2. \"saving\" `copy` reference/object as a field/provider/etc in the `DoFn` instance\n3. setting `save_main_session` to `True`\n\nI don't want to set `save_main_session` to `True` because afaiu it captures whole main session and I have bunch of objects that are not serializable in there, and overall find `save_main_session` to be smelly and hacky. 1st option is kinda smelly as well and doesn't always work - tho imports are cached so performance wise should be okish - but it would not work for my custom modules afaiu (unless I explicitly install/send them over to the workers). And lastly 2nd is kinda hacky - working around the Beam framework.\n\nI'm leaning mostly towards the 2nd option, but it just doesn't feel right to no be able to just use the global imports and workaround it be adding and using instance field(s).\n\nWhat is the best practice for this problem?
