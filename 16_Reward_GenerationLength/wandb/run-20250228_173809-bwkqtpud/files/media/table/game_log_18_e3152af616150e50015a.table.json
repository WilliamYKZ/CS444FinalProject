Traverse the tree to create a list of all nodes.\n2. Iterate over this list and build a new tree with mirrored nodes.\n\nThis approach is fine, but it has some drawbacks. It creates a temporary list which can be costly in terms of memory, especially if the tree is large. Also, it's not optimal for trees that have no shared nodes (i.e., every node has unique values).\n\nA more efficient approach would be to modify the tree in place, without creating a separate list. This could be done using recursion, but it can be tricky to get right.\n\nHowever, another way to do this efficiently is to use a stack to keep track of the nodes as you traverse the tree. You can then use this stack to rebuild the tree from the bottom up, mirroring each node as you go.\n\nHere's how you could implement this in C++:\n\n```cpp\n#include <stack>\nusing namespace std;\n\nstruct Node {\n    Node* left;\n    Node* right;\n    int value", -1.0859375], ["Question: How do you do a ternary with AngularJS (in the templates)?\n\nIt would be nice to use some in html attributes (classes and style) instead of creating and calling a function of the controller.\n\nAnswer: ", "1.

When you install git for the first time, it will generate an SSH key pair (a public key and a private key).

If you have any SSH clients or servers installed on your Mac, they may have generated the keys during installation or configuration.\n\n3) Some third-party software, such as secure file transfer tools like FileZilla or BitTorrent Sync, may also generate SSH keys if you configure them to use SSH for file transfers.\n\n4) System-wide configuration files, such as `/etc/ssh/`, may also be the source of the keys if your system is configured to use SSH for some purpose.\n\nTo find out which program generated the keys, you can check the", 5.33984375], ["Question: Just installed 12.04, then formatted an external 2 Tb drive for use.
