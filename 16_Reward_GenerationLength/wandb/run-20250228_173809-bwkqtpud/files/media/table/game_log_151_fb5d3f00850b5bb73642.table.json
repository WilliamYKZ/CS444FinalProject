The ability to see the versions of features in your site is dependent on how you have implemented and managed these versions.\n\nIn SharePoint, you can view the versions of features through the 'History' feature. This allows you to see the versions of each feature in the 'History' tab. The 'History' feature will display the history of the versions of each feature in your SharePoint environment.
