You question, the appropriate response would be to provide a detailed solution.\n\nThe user's question revolves around the concept of filtering specific lines from logs based on patterns. This involves understanding the log structure and using a specific pattern to match the desired log line. Filtering log messages can be achieved through various means, but the key is to match the pattern in the logs.\n\nHere's a detailed solution:\n\n1. Understand the pattern of the session log message in the logs. Session log messages generally have specific patterns such as timestamps, unique identifiers, etc. \n\n2. Use regular expressions to search for the exact pattern in the logs. Regular expressions allow for complex pattern matching.\n\n3. Filter out the desired pattern from other log lines.
