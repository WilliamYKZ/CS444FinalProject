Your current approach has some misunderstandings:\n\n1. **jQuery's $.getJSON**:\n   The `$.getJSON` function you're using is asynchronous, which means it starts fetching data from an API and the main thread continues with other operations. This can cause issues if you're trying to process or handle the response synchronously.\n\n2. **jQuery's DOM Manipulation**:\n   The `$(\"<span>\").html(item.time).html(\".nowtime\");` line is attempting to manipulate the HTML DOM with the retrieved time and the current time, but it doesn't make sense because you're trying to handle the response synchronously. You should use `.done()` to handle the response.\n\nTo properly solve the issue, you need to ensure that the response from the API is handled after the data is fetched. Here's how you can modify your code to properly handle the response:\n\n```javascript\n(function($) {\n    // Fetch the data asynchronously\n    $.getJSON(\"http://ws.geonames.org/timezoneJSON?lat=47.11&lng=10.2&callback=?\", \n\n    function(data) {\n        // Handle the response synchronously\n        $.each(data, function(i, item) {\n            $(\"<span>\").html(item.time).html(\".nowtime\");\n        });\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\nThis modified code will ensure that the DOM manipulation is done after the data is successfully fetched from the API. This way, the response is handled synchronously, and the DOM is manipulated after the data is successfully fetched. \n\nIn summary, the answer is: Ensure the response is handled synchronously. This way, the DOM is manipulated after the data is successfully fetched from the API. The solution should be implemented as follows: \n\n```javascript\n(function($) {\n    $.getJSON(\"http://ws.geonames.org/timezoneJSON?lat=47.11&lng=10.2&callback=?\", \n\n    function(data) {\n        $.each(data, function(i, item) {\n            $(\"<span>\").html(item.time).html(\".nowtime\");\n        });\n    }\n});\n```\n\nThe above solution ensures that the response is handled synchronously, and the DOM is manipulated after the data is successfully fetched from the API. \n\nPlease note that this solution may not work", 1.248046875], ["Question: We have a SharePoint WSS site and some of our users on on the Mac OSX platform.
