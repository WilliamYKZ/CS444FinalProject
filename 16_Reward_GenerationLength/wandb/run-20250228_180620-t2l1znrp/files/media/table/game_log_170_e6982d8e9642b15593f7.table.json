This is used as a blanket statement, as if it is an absolute.\n\nWhile tuning my database to improve performance, I keep coming across this situation that seems to contradict that rule logically for me, and nowhere can I find anyone say or explain in any way otherwise.\n\nIn SQL Server, and I believe/presume most other DBMS, your indexes are created based on specific columns you specify.

As far as I know, in wireless communication, there are several factors that prevent different TV signals from interfering with each other. Firstly, the signals are encoded differently. This means that when a signal reaches a tower, it is processed and then transmitted in a specific format. The format is unique for each TV signal.
