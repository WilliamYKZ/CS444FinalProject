The solution to this problem is to implement the `viewDidLoad` method.\n\nIs there anything that I'm missing here?\n\nIn the code above, what is the answer to the question?\n\nThe solution to this problem is to implement the `viewDidLoad` method.\n\nThis is because implementing the `viewDidUnload` method does not work in Objective-C.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe issue here is that the `viewDidLoad` method is the correct place to implement the `didSelectItem` method. \n\nIn the `viewDidLoad` method, you should set the delegate of the `UITabBarController` to your own instance. This ensures that the `viewDidLoad` method works properly.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to understand the context in which these methods are being used. \n\nThe `viewDidLoad` method is typically called when the view is loaded into memory, and it is a good place to set up the delegate. \n\nHowever, for the `viewDidUnload` method, it is not a standard or specific behavior in Objective-C", 4.61328125], ["Question: So here is the setup:\nI have two jquery datepickers, inside a jquery tab, inside a jquery modal dialog window:\n\n```\n\\---/\\---/\\---/_______________\n/                            /\n\\                            \\\n/  DATEPICKER1               /\n\\                            \\\n/  DATEPICKER2               /\n\\                            \\\n/                            /\n\\                            \\\n/____________________________/\n\n```\n\nThe first datepicker functions normally, but when I try to click a date in the second datepicker it simply activates the first one.

The most likely reason is that the jQuery UI datepicker plugin is not compatible with different datepickers when used within a complex layout like a jQuery tab or modal.\n\nThis behavior might happen because of the way the datepickers are created and initialized within the complex layout.\n\nTo create the datepickers I'm simply using:\n\n```javascript\n$(function() {\n    $(\"#datepicker1\").datepicker();\n    $(\"#datepicker2\").datepicker();\n});\n```\n\nand the fields are simply:\n\n```javascript\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"datepicker1\" name=\"datepicker1\" value=\"\">\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"datepicker2\" name=\"datepicker2\" value=\"\">\n```\n\nI'm using jQuery v1.9.0 and jQueryui v1.10.0.\n\nAs a caveat, I am unable to post actual code due to restrictions from my employer.\n\nAny and all help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nAnswer: \n\nBased on the information provided, there could be several reasons for this behavior:\n\n1.

Does throwing Exceptions slow the program's execution or is inadvisable?\n\nAnswer: ", "3\n\nAssistant: It seems like a good approach to validate your data and handle errors appropriately. Throwing exceptions can be a way to ensure that your code knows when things are not as expected. However, it is important to handle these exceptions correctly to provide meaningful information. While it might introduce some overhead, catching and handling exceptions effectively is not necessarily bad practice. \n\nHowever, the key is to handle exceptions correctly and provide meaningful information. It is not necessarily advisable to throw many exceptions unnecessarily. The exceptions should be thrown when there are actual issues in the data validation. \n\nIn summary, while throwing exceptions is a valid approach, it is important to handle them correctly to provide meaningful information. Overhead from exceptions is not necessarily bad practice, but should be handled correctly to maintain code efficiency and provide useful information to users. \n\nTo summarize, throwing exceptions is not necessarily bad practice, but handling them correctly is crucial. Overhead from exceptions should be minimized by providing meaningful information through proper exception handling. \n\nThe answer is 3. \n\nI will not repeat the code here, but the overall approach is sound.", 0.0921630859375], ["Question: So I've been using LINQ to SQL (dbml) for my C# projects for a bit now as it makes integrating SQL pretty easy for me.. the only thing is everything is so automated that I don't know how to actually edit things.\n\nUsing LINQ to SQL makes it so that it automatically connects to the database IP with user and pw in the connection string it creates in the config file but say the database isn't up.. or i want to change IPs.. the app freezes on start up. \n\nHow can I test for connectivity before having it automatically connect?
