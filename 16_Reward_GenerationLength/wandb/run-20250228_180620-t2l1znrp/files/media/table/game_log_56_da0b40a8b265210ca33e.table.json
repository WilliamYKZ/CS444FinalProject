It sounds like you're trying to detect where the mouse cursor is within a specific area on your screen using Unity. You can use the `Input.mousePosition` property to get the position of the mouse cursor. This value is a vector that indicates the position of the mouse cursor. You can compare this value with the positions you want to detect.\n\nHere is an example script that detects where the mouse cursor is within a specified area:\n\n```csharp\nusing UnityEngine;\nusing System.Collections;\n\npublic class MouseDetection : MonoBehaviour\n{\n    public float minX = 0, maxX = 1;\n    public float minY = 0, maxY = 1;\n\n    // Use this function to detect where the mouse cursor is within a specific area.\n    void Update()\n    {\n        if (Input.mousePosition.x >= minX && Input.mousePosition.x <= maxX && Input.mousePosition.y >= minY && Input.mousePosition.y <= maxY)\n        {\n            Debug.Log(\"Mouse cursor is within the area\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Debug.Log(\"Mouse cursor is outside the area\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this script, the game object has two parameters: `minX`, `maxX` for the horizontal area you want to detect, and `minY` and `maxY` for the area.
