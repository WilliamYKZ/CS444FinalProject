When I click the button to \"show modal\" the modal loads however the body of the dialog doesn't fill it's space properly, and the toolbar is mashed up against it. Upon resize everything jumps back into place nicely.\n\nI'm looking for a clean fix, so far I figure a hacky fix might be to load the modal with a zIndex that puts it behind the page body, and alter the z-index via CSS with the button click (but this seems really hackish). I could probably also programatically resize the modal after the button fires modal.show() but that would cause a visible jump in the layout which I would like to avoid.\n\nAny suggestions? I know AlloyUI has tons of hidden goodies, as their documentation is sparse, perhaps the visible attribute is not the one I should be using?\n\nAnswer: ", "1. The visible attribute is a good start, but it sounds like you're looking for a more elegant solution than a hack. There are a few approaches you could take to achieve a cleaner and more elegant solution:\n\n1. **Use the `zIndex` Property:**  \nYou can use the `zIndex` property to ensure the modal is placed behind the body when it loads. This will prevent the modal from interfering with the layout while the user clicks the button. You can set the `zIndex` of the modal to a very high number (`zIndex: 999", -0.95068359375], ["Question: Could somebody help me complete this linq left outer join query so that the second column of the right table (tempData) is contained in the result set even though it may be null?\n\n```\nsortedData = From cs In mbCustomSort\n             Order By cs(0)\n             Group Join entry In tempData On cs(joinColumn) Equals entry(0) Into Group\n             From last In Group.DefaultIfEmpty _\n             Select New With {.groupField = cs(joinColumn)}\n\n```\n\nAnswer: ", "1\n\nThis LINQ expression is an extension of LINQ and provides a method `DefaultIfEmpty` to handle null values. \n\nThe method `DefaultIfEmpty` ensures that even if the value is null, the operation can proceed.\n\nHere's the explanation:\n\nThe LINQ expression is an extension of LINQ and provides a method `DefaultIfEmpty` to handle null values.\n\nIn this case, the operation proceeds, and the operation continues.\n\nThe code snippet is a LINQ expression that uses the `DefaultIfEmpty` method to handle null values.\n\nSo, the operation can proceed", 0.2083740234375], ["Question: I have a dataframe in pandas like:\n\n```\n0                       1                   2\n([0.8898668778942382    0.89533945283595]   0)\n([1.2632564814188714    1.0207660696232244] 0)\n([1.006649166957976     1.1180973832359227] 0)\n([0.9653632916751714    0.8625538463644129] 0)\n([1.038366333873932     0.9091449796555554] 0)\n\n```\n\nAll values are strings.
