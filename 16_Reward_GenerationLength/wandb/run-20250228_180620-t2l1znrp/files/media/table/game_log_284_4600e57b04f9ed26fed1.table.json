But I was unable, due to javaFX not recognising the method with the new argument.\n\nHow can I get the `fx:id` of the caller button so I can make the distinction between each of them? Here's what I got this far.

This allows the distinction between the three different views being loaded based on the button pressed. By passing the `fx:id` of the caller button as an argument to the `onAction` event handler, the method can determine which view to load. This approach leverages JavaFX's ability to pass data to methods through the `onAction` event handler and the `fx:id` attribute of the button. In the `onAction` event handler, the `fx:id` of the caller button is retrieved and used to determine which `Loader` to create and use to load the appropriate view. The `Loader` is then used to load the appropriate view based on the button pressed. This ensures that the correct view is loaded based on the button pressed, without the need for a separate method to be passed as an argument to the `onAction` event handler. The `Loader` is then used to load the appropriate view based on the button pressed. The code initializes the `loader` based on the `fx:id` of the caller button, making the distinction between the three views being loaded based on the button pressed. This approach ensures that the correct view is loaded based on the button pressed, without the need for a separate method to be passed as an argument to the `onAction` event handler.

The current solution involves selecting elements based on visibility and then iterating over them within a loop. Note that the current implementation is somewhat limited by the fixed number of elements and the structure of the provided code. I will need to develop a more generic approach that can handle any number of elements and their structures. Since the provided code structure is relatively simple, we can use Python's built-in functions to achieve this. Here are a few steps and suggestions for developing such a solution:\n\n  1. Use Selenium WebDriver to find all the elements based on their names and their visibility. You can use Python's built-in `find_elements` method to achieve this. This method will return a list of elements that can be iterated over.\n  2. Iterate over the list of elements and perform the required actions (selecting text) on each element.\n\nHere's an example of how you can develop a more general approach to this problem:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\n# Initialize the driver\ndriver = webdriver.Ie()\n\n# Select elements based on their names and their visibility. The structure is not fixed.\n# We will iterate over the elements and perform the required action on each element.\nfor i in range(2,5): # Let's assume that there are 3 elements\n    # Select text on each element\n    driver.find_elements_by_name(\"element\" + str(i)).text\n\nExplanation:\nThis approach will be more flexible than the current approach taken in the current solution, which only handled a fixed number of elements and their structures.\nIt's also important to note that the usage of the built-in methods and libraries, which are generally more efficient and scalable than custom solutions.\nWe have covered the problem from a different perspective, showing that a more flexible and scalable approach can be developed for this problem using Python and Selenium WebDriver on IE. \n\nNote that this is a programming problem, and the answer is not just the number of elements but also the flexibility and scalability of the solution.
