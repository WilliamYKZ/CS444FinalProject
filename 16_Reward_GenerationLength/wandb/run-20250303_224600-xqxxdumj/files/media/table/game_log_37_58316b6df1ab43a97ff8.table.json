You're creating files correctly but aren't adding any content to them. The key here is that you're using the `ListBox` to filter the files. You can create the files correctly without adding any content.\n\nThe issue seems to be related to how you're trying to use the `ListBox` to filter the files. One possible solution could be to ensure you're not prematurely ending the loop when using the `ListBox`. Additionally, make sure you're not creating multiple files for each item in the `ListBox`.\n\nHere's a potential solution:\n\nInstead of using `ListBox` to filter the files, you can directly iterate over the files as per the directory. This way you're not creating multiple files for each item in the `ListBox`. Also, you can ensure you're not prematurely ending the loop.\n\nEnsure you're not prematurely ending the loop when iterating over the items in the `ListBox`.\n\nEnsure you're not creating multiple files for each item in the `ListBox`.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nIn case you still run into issues, let me know and we can further debug. \n\nThanks in for any assistance.\nQuestion: Hey guys i need a little bit of help.
