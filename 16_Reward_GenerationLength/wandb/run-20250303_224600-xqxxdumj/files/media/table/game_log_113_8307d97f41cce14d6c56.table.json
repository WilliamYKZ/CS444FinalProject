When I click the button to \"show modal\" the modal loads however the body of the dialog doesn't fill it's space properly, and the toolbar is mashed up against it. Upon resize everything jumps back into place nicely.\n\nI'm looking for a clean fix, so far I figure a hacky fix might be to load the modal with a zIndex that puts it behind the page body, and alter the z-index via CSS with the button click (but this seems really hackish). I could probably also programatically resize the modal after the button fires modal.show() but that would cause a visible jump in the layout which I would like to avoid.\n\nAny suggestions? I know AlloyUI has tons of hidden goodies, as their documentation is sparse, perhaps the visible attribute is not the one I should be using?\n\nAnswer: ", "1. **1**\n\nAnswer suggests that the visible attribute is not the one that should be used, rather than the visible attribute, perhaps a class name is the one that should be used. A clean fix, as opposed to a hacky fix would be to use a class name that puts the modal behind the body on load and alters the z-index via CSS on button click (though this may still cause a visible jump in the layout). Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Use a class name to put the modal behind the body on load and alter the z-index with CSS on click. This will ensure that the modal is loaded behind the body on load, and its z-index is altered with CSS on click. You can add a class to the element in the `onShow` event that changes the z-index of the CSS. For example, you can use a class like `modal-loaded` and add this CSS rule:\n\n```css\n.modal-loaded {\n    position: fixed;\n}\n```\n\nThis way, the modal is loaded behind the body and the z-index is altered with CSS on click.\n\nAlternatively, you could programmatically resize the modal after the button is clicked. This would mean that the modal is shown and resized after the button is clicked, maintaining the layout. However, this method does involve JavaScript, which may cause a visible jump in the layout as the modal resizes. Given the constraints and the desire for a clean solution, here are a few steps that could be taken:\n\n1. Load the modal with a class name that puts it behind the body on load.\n2. Add JavaScript to alter the z-index with CSS on click.\n3. Ensure to resize the modal after the button click, maintaining the layout.\n\nHere is a code snippet to demonstrate a clean solution:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<style>\n.modal-loaded {\n    position: fixed;\n    z-index: 9999;\n}\n</style>\n<script>\nwindow.onload = function() {\n    document.querySelector('.modal').classList.add('modal-loaded');\n}\n\ndocument.querySelector('.modal').onshow = function() {\n    document.querySelector('.modal').classList.remove('modal-loaded');\n    document.querySelector('.modal').style.zIndex = 10000;\n}\n</script>\n</head>\n<body>\n<div id=\"modal\" class=\"modal\">\n    <!-- Modal content -->\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\nThis approach ensures that the modal is loaded behind the body on load, and its z-index is altered with CSS on click, avoiding a visible jump in the layout. The solution involves minimal change to the existing structure and leverages existing technologies to achieve a clean user experience. \n\nAdditionally, consider other solutions such as using a class that changes the z-index on click, or using a library that provides a modal that doesn't have these issues, such as Bootstrap or Materialize, which have already been tested and are known to work well in", 0.72119140625], ["Question: Could somebody help me complete this linq left outer join query so that the second column of the right table (tempData) is contained in the result set even though it may be null?\n\n```\nsortedData = From cs In mbCustomSort\n             Order By cs(0)\n             Group Join entry In tempData On cs(joinColumn) Equals entry(0) Into Group\n             From last In Group.DefaultIfEmpty _\n             Select New With {.groupField = cs(joinColumn)}\n\n```\n\nAnswer: ", "2\n\nThis solution leverages the `orderby` and `join` operations to achieve the desired result.
