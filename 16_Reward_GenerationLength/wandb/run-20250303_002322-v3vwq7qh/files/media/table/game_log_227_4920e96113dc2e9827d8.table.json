At zero there is maximum correlation and after that the correlation decreases, this is an indication that the spike timings are not random and the data is not stationary. The pattern of the autocorrelogram graph indicates that the spike timings are random and the data is stationary. The autocorrelogram graph is a plot of the autocorrelograph graph.
