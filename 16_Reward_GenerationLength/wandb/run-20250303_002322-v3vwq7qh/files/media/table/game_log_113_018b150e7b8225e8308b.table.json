When I click the button to \"show modal\" the modal loads however the body of the dialog doesn't fill it's space properly, and the toolbar is mashed up against it. Upon resize everything jumps back into place nicely.\n\nI'm looking for a clean fix, so far I figure a hacky fix might be to load the modal with a zIndex that puts it behind the page body, and alter the z-index via CSS with the button click (but this seems really hackish). I could probably also programatically resize the modal after the button fires modal.show() but that would cause a visible jump in the layout which I would like to avoid.\n\nAny suggestions? I know AlloyUI has tons of hidden goodies, as their documentation is sparse, perhaps the visible attribute is not the one I should be using?\n\nAnswer: ", "1) Yes, the `visible` attribute is not the one you should be using. The `visible` attribute is used to show/hide the component itself. When you want to control the visibility of the modal based on user interaction, such as clicking a button, you should use event handlers to toggle the `visible` property. This will ensure that the modal appears only after the user clicks the button, as expected by a dialog.
