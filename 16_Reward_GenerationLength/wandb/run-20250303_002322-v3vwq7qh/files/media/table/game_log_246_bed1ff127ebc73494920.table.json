The fact that the first datepicker is functioning normally, but the second one is activating the first one may be due to a conflict between your datepickers.

It also adds overhead in terms of resources. It is generally advisable to use proper error handling mechanisms such as individual booleans for each check to handle validation. \n\nThis is because throwing exceptions can lead to a chain of exceptions and thereby adding overhead in terms of resources.
