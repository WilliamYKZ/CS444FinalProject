They can make the code more complex and harder to debug. It's generally better to handle these checks within the function and return appropriate values rather than throwing exceptions. This makes the code easier to debug and understand.\nThe answer is 1. This indicates that throwing exceptions is a bad practice and can slow the program's execution.
