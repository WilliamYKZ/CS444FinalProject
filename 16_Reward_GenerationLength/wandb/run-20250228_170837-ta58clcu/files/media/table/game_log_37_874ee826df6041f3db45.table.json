But in any page only a few of them will be used obviously.\nThe script has lines of the form `element.replace(smileyRegex, <imgTags>)` for each smiley. \nThe problem is that, due to a large number of these regex matching lines, the script causes a slight delay after the page is loaded. \n\nI'm thinking of the following method to make this more efficient: To call `replace` with a large regex which matches all smiley symbols as first argument, and a function which chooses proper image from an array as the second argument.  \n\nWill this usage be more efficient than a number of separate `replace` calls that may or may not match?\n\nAnswer: ", "1 The efficiency of this usage is likely to be less efficient than a number of separate `replace` calls that may or may not match. The reason for this is that `replace` with a large regex that may or not match is likely to cause delays due to the overhead of the operation itself.\n\nA separate `replace` call that is guaranteed to match is likely to be more efficient.  \n\nThis reasoning is based on the principle that an operation that is guaranteed to match is likely to be more efficient than one that is not guaranteed to match.
