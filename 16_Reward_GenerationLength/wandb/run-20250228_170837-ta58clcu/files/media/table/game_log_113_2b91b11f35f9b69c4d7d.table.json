When I click the button to \"show modal\" the modal loads however the body of the dialog doesn't fill it's space properly, and the toolbar is mashed up against it. Upon resize everything jumps back into place nicely.\n\nI'm looking for a clean fix, so far I figure a hacky fix might be to load the modal with a zIndex that puts it behind the page body, and alter the z-index via CSS with the button click (but this seems really hackish). I could probably also programatically resize the modal after the button fires modal.show() but that would cause a visible jump in the layout which I would like to avoid.\n\nAny suggestions? I know AlloyUI has tons of hidden goodies, as their documentation is sparse, perhaps the visible attribute is not the one I should be using?\n\nAnswer: ", "1: The `visible` attribute is not the one you should be using; it might be the `zIndex` property that you can use to put the modal behind the page body, and the `z-index` via CSS can be used to move the modal back into its space upon resize (this is quite hacky). Here are some alternative ideas that could provide a cleaner solution:\n\n1. **Use a different approach to the modal placement**: You can consider using the `modal:placement` option to adjust the position of the modal based on the content size of the window.
