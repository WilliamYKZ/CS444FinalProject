In VBScript, you can use the `CreateObject` function to create an object that represents the file, and then use the `Shell.Application.Document` property to get the path of the file. You can also use the `WScript.Arguments` variable to pass any required arguments. Here's how you can do this in VBScript:\n\nFor example, you can specify the file paths for both files in the script.
