When I click the button to \"show modal\" the modal loads however the body of the dialog doesn't fill it's space properly, and the toolbar is mashed up against it. Upon resize everything jumps back into place nicely.\n\nI'm looking for a clean fix, so far I figure a hacky fix might be to load the modal with a zIndex that puts it behind the page body, and alter the z-index via CSS with the button click (but this seems really hackish). I could probably also programatically resize the modal after the button fires modal.show() but that would cause a visible jump in the layout which I would like to avoid.\n\nAny suggestions? I know AlloyUI has tons of hidden goodies, as their documentation is sparse, perhaps the visible attribute is not the one I should be using?\n\nAnswer: ", "1. Using the visible attribute is indeed not the one you should be using. The visible attribute in AlloyUI controls whether the modal is rendered at all, rather than how its visibility or position changes on resize. Since the visible attribute does not provide a way to control the rendering based on user interaction (like showing the modal), a hacky approach can be to manipulate the DOM directly after the user action (like showing the modal) to put the modal behind the body and then use JavaScript to change the z-index of the modal after the user clicks the button.\n\nA more clean and robust solution would be to use JavaScript to control the visibility of the modal based on user interaction. You can programmatically show the modal by setting the `visible` property to true and then use JavaScript to change the `z-index` of the modal after the user clicks the button. This ensures that the modal is shown correctly and remains behind the body when the page resizes.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Set the modal's `visible` property to `true` right after the button click.\n2. Use JavaScript to change the `z-index` of the modal after the page reloads the modal.\n\nThis way, you can ensure that the modal is shown correctly and remains behind the body when the page is resized.\n\nJavaScript would look something like this:\n\n```javascript\ndocument.getElementById('modal').style.zIndex = '999'; // Make sure the modal stays behind the body even after page resize\n```\n\nAnd then use JavaScript to change the `z-index` of the modal after the user clicks the button.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```javascript\n// Show the modal immediately after the button click\ndocument.getElementById('modal').style.display = 'block';\n\n// Change the z-index of the modal after the page resize\nwindow.addEventListener('resize', function() {\n   document.getElementById('modal').style.zIndex = '999';\n });\n```\n\nBy setting the `z-index` of the modal to a very high number, it will always be behind the body and then by changing the `z-index` of the modal after the page resize event, you ensure that the modal is shown correctly and remains behind the body even after the page is resized.\n\nThis approach ensures that the modal is shown correctly and remains behind the body after the page is resized.\n\nFor the modal to remain behind the body after the page resize, you can use the following code snippet:\n\n```javascript\n// Show the modal immediately after the button click\ndocument.getElementById('modal').style.display = 'block';\n\n// Change the z-index of the modal after the page resize\nwindow.addEventListener('resize', function() {\n   document.getElementById('modal').style.zIndex = '999';\n});\n```\n\nThis way, you can ensure the modal is shown correctly and remains behind the body after the page is resized.\n\nThe final answer is: The visible attribute is not the", 3.02734375], ["Question: Could somebody help me complete this linq left outer join query so that the second column of the right table (tempData) is contained in the result set even though it may be null?\n\n```\nsortedData = From cs In mbCustomSort\n             Order By cs(0)\n             Group Join entry In tempData On cs(joinColumn) Equals entry(0) Into Group\n             From last In Group.DefaultIfEmpty _\n             Select New With {.groupField = cs(joinColumn)}\n\n```\n\nAnswer: ", "0\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the LINQ query, the second column of the table (tempData) is contained in the result set even if it is null.\n\nThis is achieved by using the `DefaultIfEmpty` method in the `Group` operation, which ensures that the second column is included in the result set even if it is null.\n\nThe correct answer is 0 because it ensures that the second column is included in the result set even if it is null.
