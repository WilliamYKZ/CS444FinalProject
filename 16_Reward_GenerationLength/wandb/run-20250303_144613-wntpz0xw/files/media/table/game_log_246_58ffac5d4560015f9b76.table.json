Here's a starting point:\n\n```python\ndef find_max(arr):\n    # \nWrite the function that returns the maximum number in the array. You should not use built-in functions like max() to solve this problem.\ndef find_max(arr):\n    max_num = arr[0]\n    for num in arr:\n        if num > max_num:\n            max_num = num\n    return max_num\n```python\n\nThis solution iterates through the list of integers, comparing each number against the current maximum found so far. If a number is larger than the current maximum, it becomes the new maximum. This process continues until the entire list has been iterated over. The largest number found during this iteration is returned as the maximum number in the array.\n\nFor an empty array, the function should return `None`.\n\nThis problem is designed to test your understanding of iterating over a list, comparing elements, and returning", 2.94921875], ["Question: So I've been using LINQ to SQL (dbml) for my C# projects for a bit now as it makes integrating SQL pretty easy for me.. the only thing is everything is so automated that I don't know how to actually edit things.\n\nUsing LINQ to SQL makes it so that it automatically connects to the database IP with user and pw in the connection string it creates in the config file but say the database isn't up.. or i want to change IPs.. the app freezes on start up. \n\nHow can I test for connectivity before having it automatically connect?

The certificate which is passed on to me is same as the one I see when I run \n\n```\nopenssl s_client -showcerts -connect \"<host>:<port>\" </dev/null 2>/dev/null|openssl x509 -outform PEM\n\n```\n2. I used <http://www.ldapsoft.com/> to connect to client's server\nUnless I add the certificate file given to me in *Security > Manage server certificates*, I get a warning saying unknown security certificate\n3.
