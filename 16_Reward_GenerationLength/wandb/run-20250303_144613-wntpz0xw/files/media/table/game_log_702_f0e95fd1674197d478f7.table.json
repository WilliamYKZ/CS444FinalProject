Here is my code. I\u00b4m trying since 2 days. :/\n\nCode for Button:\n\n```html\n<input onclick=\"change();myFunction()\" type=\"button\" value=\"Zeige Features\" id=\"myButton1\"></input>\n```\n\nCode for changing the text of button when clicked to \"hide\" / \"show\" (in German):\n\n```html\n<script>function change() // no ';' here\n{\n    var elem = document.getElementById(\"myButton1\");\n    if (elem.value==\"Zeige Features\") elem.value = \"Verstecke Features\";\n    else elem.value = \"Zeige Features\";\n}</script>\n```\n\nThe problem should be perhaps here. That\u00b4s the code for toggling the divs but only the first div does it:\n\n```html\n<script>function myFunction() {\n  var x = document.getElementById(\"toggle-div\");\n  if (x.style.display === \"block\") {\n    x.style.display = \"none\";\n  } else {\n    x.style.display = \"block\";\n  }\n} </script>\n```\n\nHope u can help me, and thanks!\n\nAnswer: ", "\u4f60\u597d\uff01\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u6b63\u5728\u5c1d\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6309\u94ae\u5207\u6362\u591a\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7c7b\u7684div\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2adiv\u5728\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u90fd\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u3002\u4f60\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5c06 `.getElementById` \u66f4\u6539\u4e3a`.getElementsByClassName`\u4f46\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u8d77\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u6211\u5417\uff1f\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e862\u5929\u3002 \n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u5207\u6362div\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u70b9\u51fb\u6309\u94ae\u88ab\u5207\u6362\u4e3a\"\u663e\u793a\"\u65f6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a\"\u9690\u85cf\"\uff0c\u6211\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5c06 `.getElementById` \u66f4\u6539\u4e3a`.getElementsByClassName`\u4f46\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u8d77\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4f60\u80fd\u5e2e\u6211\u5417\uff1f\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u6211\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u4f60\u5e2e\u6211\u3002\u8c22\u8c22\uff01\n\n\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6309\u94ae\u5207\u6362\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7c7b\u7684div\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2adiv\u5728\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u90fd\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u3002\u4f60\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5c06 `.getElementById` \u66f4\u6539\u4e3a`.getElementsByClassName`\u4f46\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u8d77\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u6211\u5417\uff1f\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u6211\u8bd5\u56fe\u4ece\u7b2c2\u5929\u5f00\u59cb\uff1a \n\n```html\n<script>\nfunction myFunction() {\n  var x = document.getElementById(\"toggle-div\");\n  if (x.style.display === \"block\") {\n    x.style.display = \"none\";\n  } else {\n    x.style.display = \"block\";\n  }\n} </script>\n```\n\n\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4e8e\u8fd9\u91cc\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u5207\u6362div\u4f46\u53ea\u6709\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2adiv\u6267\u884c\u3002\u4f60\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u6211\u5417\uff1f\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u6211\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u6211\u8bd5\u7740\u4ece\u7b2c2\u5929\u5f00\u59cb\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002 \n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u5207\u6362div\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u6309\u94ae\u88ab\u5207\u6362\u4e3a\u201c\u663e\u793a\u201d\u65f6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a\u201c\u9690\u85cf\u201d\uff0c\u6211\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5c06 `.getElementById`\u66f4\u6539\u4e3a`.getElementsByClassName`\u4f46\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u8d77\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4f60\u80fd\u5e2e\u6211\u5417\uff1f\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u4f60\u80fd\u5e2e\u6211\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n```html\n<script>\nfunction myFunction() {\n  var x = document.getElementById(\"toggle-div\");\n  if (x.style.display === \"block\") {\n    x.style.display = \"none\";\n  } else {\n    x.style.display = \"block\";\n  }\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4e8e\u8fd9\u91cc\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u5207\u6362div\u7684\u7c7b\u4f46\u53ea\u6709\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2adiv\u6267\u884c\u3002\u4f60\u80fd\u5e2e\u6211\u5417\uff1f\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u4f60\u80fd\u5e2e\u6211\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8c22\u8c22\u4f60\uff01\n\u5f53\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6839\u636e\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n1. \u786e\u4fdd `getElementsByClassName` \u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u786e\u3002\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n```html\n<script>\nfunction myFunction() {\n  var x = document.getElementsByClassName(\"toggle-div\");\n", -5.39453125]]}
