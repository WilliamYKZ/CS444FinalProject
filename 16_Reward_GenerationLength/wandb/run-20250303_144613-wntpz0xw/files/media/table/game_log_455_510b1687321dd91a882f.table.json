I am working with \"standard\" EXR, as I understand that the EXR multilayer is for multiple file handling (packing all the image files into a single container), but I may be wrong.\n\n![EXR export not working](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GbNqY.jpg)\n\nIn the screenshot, the graphic is an EXR saved from the rendered layer; you can see in the screenshot how the \"extra\" passes from the render layer has been ignored by the graphic and only shows the standard *image*, *z* and *alpha* passes.
