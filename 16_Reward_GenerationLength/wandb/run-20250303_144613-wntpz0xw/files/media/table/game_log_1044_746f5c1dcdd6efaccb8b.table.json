Shell scripting provides tools and mechanisms to read from a program's output and assign variables based on that output.\n\nFor instance, if you have a program that outputs different values and you want to set a variable based on that output, you can use `read` command to read the output line by line and assign the variable accordingly.\n\nHere is how you could have done it:\n\n```bash\nfunction example\n    output=$(your_program)\n    while IFS read line\n        case $line in\n            \"VALUE 1\"|\"VALUE 1\"\n            do\n                eval (FOO=$line)\n        fi\n        do\n        do\n        do\n        done\n    done\n    echo $FOO\n```\n\n\nThis allows you to properly handle the output of a program and assign variables based on that output. By using `IFS` to read the output line by line and `eval` to assign the variable accordingly, you can ensure that the variable is set as expected.\n\nExplanation:\nIn bash scripting, handling output from a program and assigning variables based on that output can be done by reading the output line by line and assigning the variable accordingly.
