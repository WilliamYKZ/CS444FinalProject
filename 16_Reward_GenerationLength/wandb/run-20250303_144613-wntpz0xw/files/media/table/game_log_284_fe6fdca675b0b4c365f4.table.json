This allows you to select text at the beginning of the text in the main of the page, without additional menus or extensions. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```javascript\nvar allText = document.querySelectorAll('div'); // Select all divs\nallText.forEach(function(text){\n  var selection = document.querySelector(text);\n  selection.select(); // Select the text\n```\n\nThis code selects all text within sections of a webpage without having to select from top to bottom with the mouse.\n\nThanks,\n\nAnswer 1.

I want to load one of three different views depending on which of them is pressed. To do so, I thought about passing as an argument the button itself. But I was unable, due to javaFX not recognising the method with the new argument.\n\nHow can I get the `fx:id` of the caller button so I can make the distinction between each of them? Here's what I got this far. I just need to initialize `pressed` variable so it will do its thing.\n\n```\nif (pressed == edgeModify){\n    loader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource(\"/digitalia/view/edgeView.fxml\"));\n} else if (pressed == sectionModify){\n    loader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource(\"/digitalia/view/sectionView.fxml\"));\n} else {\n    loader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource(\"/digitalia/view/LayerView.fxml\"));\n}\n\n```\n\nAnswer: ", "1\n\nThe issue here is that JavaFX does not allow method overloading based on the argument type, which means you cannot pass the button itself as an argument to differentiate the buttons in your application. The solution lies in using another approach to differentiate the buttons such as using an event parameter to a single method, where you can pass the button as an event and check for the button in the method.\n\nHere's how you can implement the method to load different views based on the button pressed:\n\n```java\npublic void loadView(ActionEvent event) {\n    Loader loader = null;\n    \n    switch (event.getSource()) {\n        case edgeModify:\n            loader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource(\"/digitalia/view/edgeView.fxml\")));\n            break;\n        case sectionModify:\n            loader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource(\"/digitalia/view/sectionView.fxml\")));\n            break;\n    }\n    scene.setPrimaryStage(event);\n}\n```\n\nJavaFX provides an event object which contains information about the event such as the source which is the component which triggered the event. By passing the source as an event parameter to a method, you can differentiate between the buttons in your application without needing to pass the button itself as an argument.\n\nThis method allows you to handle events in a way that does not rely on method overloading based on the argument type, providing a solution to your problem.\n\nThis solution leverages the JavaFX event model to handle button presses by passing the button itself as an event parameter to a method.
