This all works fine but it seems very redundant as I have 6 grades to convert and 5 if statements for each just to show letters and then another one for average grade. It's important to make this less redundant. We can do this by creating a dictionary that maps grades to grades.

By mapping grades to values and grades, we can create a dictionary that maps grades to their corresponding values and letter grade. We can then create a function that takes in a grade and returns the corresponding value and letter grade. This makes the code less redundant as we avoid having multiple if statements for each grade. \n\nHere's how we can make this less redundant:\n\n```c\nlet gradeDictionary = {\n    'A': 80,\n    'B':70,\n    // Add more grades to the dictionary\n}\n\n// Create a function that takes in a grade and returns the corresponding grade value and letter grade\nfunction calculateGrade(grade) {\n    let gradeValue;\n    // Add more grades to the dictionary and create a function that takes in a grade and returns the corresponding value and letter grade\n    if (gradeDictionary[grade] >= 80) {\n        return 'A', 80;\n    } else if (gradeDictionary[grade] >= 70 && gradeDictionary[grade] <= 99) {\n        return 'B', 70;\n    }\n    // Add more grades to the dictionary and create a function that takes in a grade and returns the corresponding value and letter grade\n```\n\nAnswer: You're right! This approach avoids having multiple if statements for each grade.
