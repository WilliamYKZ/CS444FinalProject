The `$.each(data)` loop is replaced with `$.each(data, function(i,item))`. This allows iterating over the keys of the JSON object instead of the items themselves. \n\nThis is achieved by passing `i` as the key and `item` as the item into the loop to the callback.\n\nNote: This solution assumes that the JSON data will have a structure where the time is available under a key.
