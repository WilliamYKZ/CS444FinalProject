Instead, you are expanding the path using `realpath` from the standard library. This approach works by resolving the path using `realpath` which handles the tilde and path expansions, allowing you to use the expanded path for actions with `NSFileManager`.\n\nThis approach directly addresses the limitation by using the `realpath` function from the standard library to resolve the path and its expansions, ensuring the expanded path can be used for actions with `NSFileManager`. This resolves the issue of the path expansion not being handled by the methods provided by the system. \n\nThe solution is straightforward in understanding and implementation, leveraging the functionality provided by the standard library to resolve the path and its expansions, ensuring the expanded path can be used for", 4.04296875], ["Question: I want to check code from the repository <http://code.sixapart.com/svn/perlbal/> .
