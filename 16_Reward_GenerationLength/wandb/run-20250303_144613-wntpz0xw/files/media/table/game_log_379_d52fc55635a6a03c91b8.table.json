I've eliminated the duplicated lines. Is there any other way to get rid of the duplicated lines? Answer: The approach you're taking involves eliminating duplicated lines is by using a combination of the `SELECT DISTINCT *` statement and ensuring that the `p1.psn_id <> p2.psn_id` condition. The key difference in the ages is the `p1.psn_age - p2.psn_age <= 5`. However, if you want to ensure that each person appears only once in the final result, regardless of whether the differences are exact or not, you could use the `DISTINCT` keyword as you did, which ensures that each distinct pair `(p1, p2)` where `p1.psn_id <> p2.psn_id` and `p1.psn_age - p2.psn_age <= 5` is included only once in the result. This approach avoids the issue of duplicates by ensuring each person appears only once in the final result.
