For example, if a map is on page 1, the NPC can cut out page 1 and insert the map onto an empty space or a damaged space. This will create the appearance that the page has been repaired but did not actually fix the page.\n\n2. **Use Visual Hints:** The NPC can provide visual hints or clues to the party about the repairs being made.
