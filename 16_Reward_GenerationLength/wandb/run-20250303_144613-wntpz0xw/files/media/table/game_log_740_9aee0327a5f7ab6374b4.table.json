Many applications expect the focus of the mouse cursor to be moved to them when they are active, and in the case of inactive windows, to become active. This can lead to situations where a second click is needed to actually click the button. The solution to this issue is to ensure that when you move the cursor over an inactive window, it becomes active, and thus clicking the button.\n\nThis can be achieved by setting up your system to make sure that when you move the cursor over an inactive window, it becomes active, and thus clicks the button.

The probability of the result of Random(a,b) should be pure uniformly distributed, as Random(0,1)**\n\nFor the Random function, the results are integers between a and b, inclusively.

Here's why:\n\n1. The key concept in generating a uniformly distributed integer is to use the `Random` function to generate a pseudo-random integer within the specified range (a, b), inclusively. The results are integers between a and b, inclusively. For example, `Random(0,1)` generates either 0 or 1.\n1. To generate a uniformly distributed integer in a range using `Random(0,1)`, you need to use the `Random` function to generate a random integer within the range (a, b), inclusively, and then map this integer to a uniform distribution. This can be done by taking advantage of the fact that `Random(0,1)` returns a value between 0 and 1. You can use this to map the generated integer to a uniform distribution. \n\nThe correct solution for generating a uniformly distributed integer in a range using `Random(0,1)` would be:\n\n```\nr = a\nfor i = 1 to b - a //including b-a\n    r += Random(0,1)\nreturn r\n```\n\nThe reason why `r += Random(0,1)` makes r not uniformly distributed is because adding a random number to an integer does not preserve the uniform distribution. A correct solution for generating a uniformly distributed integer in a range using `Random(0,1)` should involve mapping the integer to a uniform distribution.\n\nYour new solution is correct.
