When i tried to install the new version of php, the old folder in C://xampp would delete. I deleted everything from that folder except memcached which I can't delete beacuse someone else is using it. So i installed the new xampp version in xampp54 folder.\n\nWhen i installed the new xampp version, i get this errors for mysql\n\n```\nExpected Path: \"c:\\xampp54\\apache\\bin\\httpd.exe\" -k runservice\nMySQL Service detected with wrong path\nChange XAMPP MySQL and Control Panel settings or\nUninstall/disable the other service manually first\nFound Path: C:\\xampp\\mysql\\bin\\mysqld.exe --defaults-file=c:\\xampp\\mysql\\bin\\my.ini     mysql\nExpected Path: c:\\xampp54\\mysql\\bin\\mysqld.exe --defaults-file=c:\\xampp54\\mysql\\bin\\my.ini mysql\n\n```\n\nWhen i try starting apache, i doesn't do anything. Anyone knows how to fix this?\n\nAnswer: ", "\u4ece MySQL \u4e2d\u5220\u9664\u4e86 XAMPP\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fee\u590d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u77e5\u9053\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u5728 XAMPP \u4e2d\u5220\u9664\u4e86 MySQL \u7684\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u6211\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\n\n```\nExpected Path: \"c:\\xampp44\\apache\\bin\\httpd.exe\" -k runservice\nService Service detected with wrong path\nChange XAMPP MySQL and Control Panel settings or\nUninstall/Disable the other service manually first\nFound Path: C:\\xampp\\mysql\\bin\\mysqld.exe --defaults-file=C:\\xampp\\mysql\\bin\\my.ini     mysql\nExpected Path: c:\\xampp\\mysql\\bin\\mysqld.exe --defaults-file=C:\\xampp\\mysql\\bin\\my.ini\n```\n\n\u5f53\u6211\u5728Apache\u4e2d\u5f00\u59cbApache\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u6ca1\u6709\u505a\u4efb\u4f55\u4e8b\u60c5\u3002\u6211\u4ece\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u90a3\u91cc\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6709\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5b83\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u5b89\u88c5\u4e86\u65b0\u7684XAMPP\u7248\u672c\u5728xampp44\u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u4e2d\u3002\n\n\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5982\u4f55\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n\u7b54\u6848\uff1a\n\n1. \u4ece MySQL \u4e2d\u5220\u9664\u4e86 XAMPP\n\n\u89e3\u91ca\uff1a\u5f53\u6211\u5728Apache\u4e2d\u5f00\u59cbApache\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u6ca1\u6709\u505a\u4efb\u4f55\u4e8b\u60c5\u3002\u6211\u4ece\u90a3\u91cc\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6709\u4eba\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5b83\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u5b89\u88c5\u4e86\u65b0\u7684XAMPP\u7248\u672c\u5728xampp44\u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u6211\u4ece\u90a3\u91cc\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u65e7\u7684XAMPP\u7248\u672c\u5728xampp44\u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u7f13\u5b58\u3002\u8fd9\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u4ece MySQL \u4e2d\u5220\u9664\u4e86 XAMPP\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fee\u590d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u5728 XAMPP \u4e2d\u5220\u9664\u4e86 MySQL \u7684\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u6211\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u65e7\u7684 XAMPP \u7248\u672c\u5728 xampp44 \u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u4e2d\u3002\n\n\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u5728 XAMPP \u4e2d\u5220\u9664\u4e86 MySQL \u7684\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u6211\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u65e7\u7684 XAMPP \u7248\u672c\u5728 xampp44 \u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u4e2d\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u4ece MySQL \u4e2d\u5220\u9664\u4e86 X", -0.62890625]]}
