When trying to create a table from a class object using CL_SALV_TABLE, if the table is read-only, you cannot pass it directly. Since your table is read-only, it cannot be passed as a `CHANGING` parameter, but not as a direct value, you are not allowed to pass it directly.\n\nTo illustrate a table from a class instance using CL_SALV_TABLE when the table is read-only, you should use a `CHANGING` parameter, which allows you to pass the table as a `CHANGING` parameter, ensuring the table is passed correctly.\n\nIn this approach, the table is passed through a `CHANGING` parameter, allowing you to pass the table as a `CHANGING` parameter, ensuring the table is passed correctly.\n\nThe code to create a table from a class instance using CL_SALV_TABLE, when the table is read-only, you should use a `CHANGING` parameter, which allows you to pass the table as a `CHANGING` parameter, ensuring the table is passed correctly.\n\n```python\ncl_salv_table=factory( \n          IMPORTING r_salv_table = DATA(lr_salv_table)  \n          CHANGING  t_table = <lt_table>)\n\n```python\n\nThis ensures the table is passed correctly.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n\\text{Use a `CHANGING` parameter to pass the table, since the table is read-only, it cannot be passed as a `CHANGING` parameter, ensuring the table is passed correctly.

This approach meets the requirement to pass the table as a `CHANGING` parameter, ensuring the table is passed correctly. \n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\text{Use a `CHANGING` parameter to pass the table, since the table is read-only, it can be passed as a `CHANGING` parameter, ensuring the table is passed correctly. \n\nThis ensures the table is passed correctly as a `CHANGING` parameter. \n\nThe code to create a table from a class instance using CL_SALV_TABLE, when the table is read-only, uses a `CHANGING` parameter, ensuring the table is passed correctly. \n\nThe final code is:\n\n```python\ncl_salv_table=factory( \n          IMPORTING r_salv_table = DATA(lr_salv_table) \n          CHANGING  t_table = <lt_table>)\n```\n\nThis meets the requirement to pass the table as a `CHANGING` parameter,", 0.7666015625], ["Question: Windows was able to fix the issue.

Since your research indicates that it is `\\n` (line feed or line break), but when it loads the file, it does not show these, only when it replaces them, they appear. To ensure the correct reading of the data, one approach would be to use the `replace` method with appropriate replacement.\n\nHere's how you can handle it in Python using Pandas to read the file:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Reading the file with the appropriate replacement\ndata = pd.read_csv('ratings.dat', sep='\\|')\n\n# Converting the line breaks back to the desired format\ndata['rating'] = data['rating'].replace('\\n', ':').replace(' ', '').replace '\\x0a': '' \n\n# Reading the file with appropriate formatting\ndf = pd.read_csv('ratings.dat', sep='\\|', converters={'rating': lambda x: x.replace('\\n', ':'))}\n\nThis will convert the line breaks to the format required for data reading. Since the data reading process in R Studio is detecting the format differently than expected, using the appropriate replacement method ensures the correct format for data reading. This solution assumes that the data processing and reading processes are being detected differently than expected, and the appropriate replacement method ensures the correct format for data reading.\n\nIn summary, if you do not want to use the Python code for converting this, the solution for the issue of loading the file correctly in data reading could be to use the appropriate replacement method.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
