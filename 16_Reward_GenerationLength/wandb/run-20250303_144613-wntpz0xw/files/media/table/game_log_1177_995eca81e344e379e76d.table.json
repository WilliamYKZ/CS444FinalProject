Easy right? I thought so, and still managed to mess up!\n\nSo my current query is this:\n\n```\n  SELECT Area, \n         Address, \n         Property_Code, \n         Property_Type, \n         Price, \n         Market_Date, \n         Sold\n    FROM tbl_Sale_Property\n   WHERE (\n           Price IN (\n                      SELECT MIN(Price) \n                        FROM tbl_Sale_Property \n                    GROUP BY Property_Type\n                    ) \n           OR Price IN (\n                      SELECT MAX(Price) \n                        FROM tbl_Sale_Property \n                    GROUP BY Property_Type\n                    )\n          )\nORDER BY Property_Type;\n\n```\n\nWhich from my (very limited) experience should return every min/max priced record for each property type. My thinking was that if it just checked whether the price was a MIN or MAX and sorted it after, this would work.\nUnfortunately, for some reason, it returns more than two records for some of the property types-\nSemi-Detached returns: \n\n* \u00a3120,000.00\n* \u00a3210,000.00\n* \u00a3210,000.00\n* \u00a3210,000.00\n* \u00a3380,000.00\n\nWhen it should return only the highest and lowest numbers.Any help would be greatly appreciated!\nI apologise again if this has been answered previously or is super mind numbingly simple!\nI'm using Access 2007-2010.\n\nAnswer: ", " Your query is almost correct!

To delete a namespace created in kubernetes, you can use the `kubectl` command with the `delete` subcommand. The command executed would be:\n\n```bash\nkubectl delete namespace devops-ui\n```\n\nSince the command is taking too long to execute and the resource is still in a terminal state, this might be due to the namespace being used having some resources.\n\nA solution could be to first list the resources in the namespace using the `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces` command (or similar). This will help to identify the specific resource that is still in a terminal state and needs more time to finish.\n\nOnce identified, you can delete it using the `kubectl delete <resource_name>` command.\n\nThis process may require multiple executions of the delete command until all resources are deleted and no longer in a terminal state.\n\nBelow is a python implementation using the `kubectl` library:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Execute the command to list the pods in the namespace\nsubprocess.check_call([\"kubectl\", \"get\", \"pods\", \"--all-namespaces\"])\n\n# Identify the resource that is still in a terminal state\n# Replace <resource_name>\nsubprocess.check_call([\"kubectl\", \"delete\", \"<resource_name>\"])\n\n# Wait for the resource to be out of a terminal state\nimport time\nwhile True:\n    # Execute the command to check the state of the pods in the namespace\n    output = subprocess.check_output([\"kubectl\", \"get\", \"pods\",\"--all-namespaces\"])\n    \n    if all_resources_no_longer_in_terminal_state:\n        break\n    time.sleep(60)\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that all resources in the namespace are deleted and the namespace itself is deleted only after all resources are out of a terminal state.\n\nNote: The actual implementation might require handling of possible errors and ensuring the script is robust and reliable.\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Function to delete a namespace in kubernetes and ensure all resources are deleted from a terminal state\ndef delete_namespace_with_resources(namespace):\n    # Delete the namespace\n    subprocess.check_call([\"kubectl\", \"delete\", \"namespace\", namespace])\n    \n    # List the pods in the namespace to check", 2.3671875], ["Question: I would like to take a div and have the background fade to white on mouseenter and fade back out to black on mouseout.
