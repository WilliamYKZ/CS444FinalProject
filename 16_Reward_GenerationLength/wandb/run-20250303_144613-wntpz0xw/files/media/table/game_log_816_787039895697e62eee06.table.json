This is achieved by using the `super` keyword. Here's an example of how it's used in a real-world scenario:\n\nConsider a scenario where a company develops a banking application. They have a superclass named `Account` that defines a method `withdraw`. They have a subclass named `CheckingAccount` that provides a specific implementation of the `withdraw` method. The `super` keyword is used to call the `withdraw` method of the `Account` superclass in the `CheckingAccount` subclass. This demonstrates method overriding in Java. \n\n", -3.8671875], ["Question: i am using youtube player api in android.
