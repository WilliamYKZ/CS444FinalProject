To achieve the desired layout where `one` and `two` are placed side-by-side with `three` and `four` below them in a 2x2 grid, you need to use CSS Flexbox or Flex properties. By setting the flex-direction to column-reverse, the child elements will be arranged in a column from bottom to top.\n\nHere is an example using HTML and CSS:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"container\" style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column-reverse\">\n    <div class=\"one\">testing one</div>\n    <div class=\"two\">testing two</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"container\" style=\"display: flex;flex-direction: column-reverse\">\n    <div class=\"one\">testing three</div>\n    <div class=\"two\">testing four</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThis will arrange the elements in a column from bottom to top, ensuring that `one` and `two` are next to each other and `three` and `four` are below them. The `one` and `two` will be on top of `three` and `four` because they are first in the flow of elements.\n\nIf you prefer a different layout where `one` and `two` are on top of `three` and `four`, you can use Flexbox as follows:\n\n```css\n#container {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n}\n.one {\n    background-color: lightblue;\n}\n.two {\n    background-color: lightgreen\n}\n.three {\n    background-color: yellow\n}\n.four {\n    background-color: red\n}\n```\n\nThis will ensure that `one` and `two` are on top of `three` and `four`.\n\nIf you are looking for a different layout where `one` and `two` are on top of `three` and `four`, you can use CSS Flexbox or Flex properties.

This can result in the deployment failing due to the target database schema being undetermined.\n\nTo make Visual Studio deploy the database into SQL Azure, you need to ensure that the database schema is properly defined and understood by Azure.
