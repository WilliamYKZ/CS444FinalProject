To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the URLs provided are consistent and point to the same location for the `download` attribute to work as expected.\n\nTo explain why the `download` attribute works differently based on the URLs provided:\n\n1. In the first scenario, the URL is the exact path where the file can be found. Hence, the download prompt is to save the file from the provided URL. This works because the URL provided is the same domain as the resource being downloaded. \n   \n2. In the second scenario, the URL provided is a different domain than the resource being downloaded. Hence, the prompt prompt is to save the file from the different domain, which may not be allowed or supported by the browser.
