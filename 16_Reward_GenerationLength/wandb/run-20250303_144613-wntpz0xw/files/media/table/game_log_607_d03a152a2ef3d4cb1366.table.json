We noticed that it happens only when the image is different from previous one (but not always... it's easier to observe it on the weaker internet connection).

.Net tool to create simple .Net applications that the non-programmer superiors can use. How would I go about writing and compiling the code?\n\n**Explanation of intent:** I want my superiors to, rather than ask me to make a barcode label app, select a few options, do a few test prints and then have the application created and ready to reuse. But how do I go about writing the output application for them to reuse on other machines?\n\nAlso, is this a terrible idea or have some merit?\n\n**Edit:** To all those suggesting configurability over my original question: all the apps we release for internal use are being used by essentially day labor and my superiors prefer the applications to be static and unconfigurable. That being said, some of our apps haven't changed in 5 or 6 years because they were made to the specifications required. In the last few weeks they have requested 2 new barcode apps with a third requested in passing.\n\nAnswer: ", "1.

Can you prevent this error from occurring serverside?\n\nAs an example, you have already edited the file and added this right after the opening tag in the cpanel server:\n\n```html\n<meta HTTP-EQUIF=\"REFRESH\" CONTENT=\"0\" URL=\"http://www.example.com\">\n```\n\n\nTo quote: Centos cPanel server - Apache/PHP.\n\nIs there any way you can prevent this error from occurring serverside?\n\nAssistant: To prevent this error from occurring serverside, you need to ensure that the `$_SERVER['HTTP-EQUIF']` variable is set to `0` and the `$_SERVER['URL']` variable is set to the target URL. PHP script. This can be achieved by editing the file as follows:\n\n```apache\n<meta HTTP-EQUIF=\"REFRESH\" CONTENT=\"0\" URL=\"http://www.example.com\">\n```\n\nThis modification ensures that the `$_SERVER['HTTP-EQUIF']` variable is set to `0`, preventing the `$_SERVER['URL']` variable from being set to the target URL. PHP script. This approach prevents the `REFRESH` directive from triggering.\n\nHere is the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Prevent the REFRESH directive from triggering\n\nimport os\n\n# Function to prevent the REFRESH directive from triggering\n\ndef prevent_refresh(content):\n\n    # Set the REFRESH directive to 0 and the URL to the target URL\n\n    os.environ['HTTP-EQUIF'] = '0'\n    os.environ['URL'] = 'http://www.example.com'\n\n# Test the function\nimport os\n\n# Function to prevent the REFRESH directive from triggering\n\ndef prevent_refresh(content):\n\n    # Set the REFRESH directive to 0 and the URL to the target URL\n    os.environ['HTTP-EQUIF'] = '0'\n    os.environ['URL'] = 'http://www.example.com'\n\n# Test the function\nprevent(\"http://www.example.com\")\n```\n\nThis prevents the `REFRESH` directive from triggering.\n\nThe key to prevent this error from occurring serverside is to ensure that the `$_SERVER['HTTP-EQUIF']` variable is set to `0` and the `$_SERVER['URL']` variable is set to the target URL. This can be achieved by editing the file as follows:\n\n```apache\n<meta HTTP-EQUIF=\"REFRESH\" CONTENT=\"", -0.50634765625]]}
