This also ensures consistency across commands, even when the `-f` flag has a different default behaviour in more recent versions of the `mv` command.\n\nWhile the notes indicate that if you specify more than one of the `-i`, `-f`, `-n` flags, only the final one affects the command, this seems unlikely of the intention of the `-f` flag is to override the `-i` flag in general, because more concise and comprehensible methods of achieving this (such as using `mv -if`) are available in more recent versions of the `mv` command.\n\nThus, the purpose of the `-f` flag is to maintain consistency across commands, even when the `-f` flag has a different default behaviour in more recent versions of the `mv` command. \n\nThe above answer is 1, because the purpose of the `-f` flag is to maintain consistency across commands, even when the `-f` flag has a different default behaviour in more recent versions of the `mv` command. \n\nThis ensures that the `-f` flag is used to override the `-i` flag in more recent versions of the `mv` command, while allowing more concise and comprehensible methods of achieving this in more recent versions of the `mv` command. \n\nThis also underscores the point that the `-f` flag", -0.71142578125], ["Question: Which is the fastest way of calling a native library from Java?\n\nThe ones I know about are\n\n* [NativeCall](http://johannburkard.de/software/nativecall/) - what we're currently using\n* [JNA](http://jna.java.net/) - haven't used it, but looks reasonable\n* [JNI](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/jni/) - looks horrendous to write, but we'll do it if we get the speed\n\nAnswer: ", " NativeCall\n\nThe other approaches would have written that the way of writing a code, this one was the fastest.\n\nThis is because the native call approach, this one is the fastest.\n\nThis is because the native call approach, this one looks horrendous to write, but we'll do it if we get the speed.
