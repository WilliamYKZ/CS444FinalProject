The first sentence \"It **had been raining**\" conveys the idea of stopping raining when the person left.

The difference lies in the temporal aspect of the sentences. \n\nThe sentences can be analyzed and the temporal aspect is important. \n\nThe first sentence \"It **had been raining**\" suggests that the rain continued until the time when the person left the house.

In other words, it's always `localhost:3000`, no matter what route I'm on. How so?\n\nAnswer: ", " The issue arises from the way React Router handles browser history when server-side rendering is involved. By default, `BrowserRouter` sets up a history object that can navigate routes based on the URL. However, in the context of server-side rendering, the client-side history object doesn't reflect the actual URL. This means that the path remains constant, always being `localhost:3000`, regardless of the route.\n\nTo solve this issue, the solution involves the change from `BrowserRouter` to `Router` and passing `history` by using a function.\n\n```\nfunction App() {\n\n    const history = createMemoryHistory();\n\n    return (\n        <div className=\"App\">\n        <Router history={history}>\n        <ScrollToTop>\n        <Header/>\n        <Route path=\"/project/:name\" component={Project}/>\n        < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            <path path=[\"/\", \"/project/:name\"]} exact component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs-mobile\">\n            <path path=\"/\" exact component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"hs\">\n            < path path=\"/about\" component={About}/>\n       ", -0.10601806640625], ["Question: I have rspec test code like this\n\n```\ndescribe 'Utils' do\n\n  puts 1111\n  describe '#time_condition' do\n    puts 2221\n    it do\n      puts 'aaa'\n    end\n    puts 2223\n  end\nend\n\n```\n\nmy launch.json like this\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"RSpec -
