The code you provided has a misunderstanding about the conversion from radians to degrees in C++. Let's resolve the problem correctly. Here is the detailed solution in C++:\n\n```cpp\n#include <cmath>\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    // Correct approach, let's resolve the problem correctly.\n    // We need to understand the conversion from radians to degrees and how the `tan` function works in C++. \n// The input angle is given in radians, not degrees.\n    double angle_in", -0.018035888671875], ["Question: I have been asked to create a list of franchises that have the most revenue grouped by years, however the order by clause needs to order by franchises who have had the most revenue depending on the date range. I can order them by the single sum(revenue) fine but how do I order the franchise groupings by revenue? \n\n```\ngroup by\n    vFranMasterNumRollup.MasterFranNumber, \n    REPLACE(vFranMasterNumRollup.FranchiseName, ',', '') ,\n    YEAR(vremittheaderdetailandfran.remd_ServiceDate)\norder by\n    sum(vremittheaderdetailandfran.remd_LaborRevenue) desc,\n    REPLACE(vFranMasterNumRollup.FranchiseName, ',', '')\n\n```\n\nyou see here I've tried to add another column to the ordering but I want to keep the highest franchise group together in the descending order\n\nLet me know if you need any more code\n\nHere is more of the code:\n\n```\nSELECT     vFranMasterNumRollup.MasterFranNumber, REPLACE(vFranMasterNumRollup.FranchiseName, ',', '') AS FranchiseName, \nsum(vremittheaderdetailandfran.remd_LaborRevenue),YEAR(vremittheaderdetailandfran.remd_ServiceDate) \nFROM         vremittheaderdetailandfran INNER JOIN\n                      vFranMasterNumRollup ON vremittheaderdetailandfran.remh_FranchiseNumber = vFranMasterNumRollup.fran_FranchiseID\nWHERE     (vremittheaderdetailandfran.remd_ServiceDate BETWEEN @startdate and @enddate AND (vFranMasterNumRollup.fran_Status = N'ACTIVE') OR\n                      (vremittheaderdetailandfran.remd_ServiceDate BETWEEN @startdate and @enddate))\ngroup by vFranMasterNumRollup.MasterFranNumber, \nREPLACE(vFranMasterNumRollup.FranchiseName, ',', '') , YEAR(vremittheaderdetailandfran.remd_ServiceDate)\norder by sum(vremittheaderdetailandfran.remd_LaborRevenue) desc,REPLACE(vFranMasterNumRollup.FranchiseName, ',', '')\n\n```\n\nAnswer: ", " To order the groupings by revenue, you should order the groupings by revenue, not by the name of the franchise.
