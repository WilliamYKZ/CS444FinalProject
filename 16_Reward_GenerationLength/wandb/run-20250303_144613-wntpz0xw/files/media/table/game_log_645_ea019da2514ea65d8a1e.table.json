The compiler is designed to handle the structure of files in a directory to infer the package structure. However, it may not fully understand the nuances of the structure. This is because the file structure alone does not provide enough information to infer the structure. For example, consider a scenario where the same file has different package definitions due to context or usage of the file, which the compiler would not understand. Another example, a project structure may have the same file in different directories with different package mappings, the compiler would not understand.\n\nBased on the above discussion, what changes to the compiler or the project structure can help the compiler better understand the structure of the code? To make the compiler better understand the structure of the code, changes to the compiler or project structure can include:\n\n1. **Refactoring**: Refactoring the structure of files and directories to infer the structure more accurately. For instance, renaming a file or moving a file to a new directory can help the compiler understand the structure.\n\n2. **Contextual Information**: Providing additional contextual information about the structure can help the compiler understand the structure.
