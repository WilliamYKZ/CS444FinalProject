It is *separable* if there exists a countable $S \\subseteq X$ such that $O \\cap S \\neq \\emptyset$ for every nonempty $O \\in \\tau$. It is well known that second countability is strictly stronger than separability.\n\nI'm working on something hinges on an intermediate property: \"there exists a countable subset $C \\subseteq \\tau$ [edit: with each $C$-member *nonempty*!] that is dense in $\\tau$, in the sense that for all $O \\in \\tau$, there exists $P \\in C$ such that $P \\subseteq O$.\"\n\n**Is there a common name for this property?** I will call it \"property C\" for now.\n\nSecond countability implies property C (since a countable basis for $\\tau$ is dense in $\\tau$), which implies separability (choose one member from each $P \\in C$ and the set of all the choices serves as the $S$ in the definition of separability). The Moore plane is an example of a topology that has property C but is not second countable.\n\n**Are there examples of topological spaces that are separable but do not have property C?**\n\nAnswer: ", "1. Yes. To elaborate, a countable basis $B \\subseteq \\tau$ is dense in $\\tau$ means that every open set $O \\in \\tau$ has a countable subset $P \\in B$ such that $P \\subseteq O$.
