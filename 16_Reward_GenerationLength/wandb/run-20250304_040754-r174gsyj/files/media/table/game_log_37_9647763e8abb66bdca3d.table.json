You're also creating a StreamWriter that will write to each file found. However, the files are not being written to as expected. \n\nYour current approach seems a bit off.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n1. **Instead of the way you currently do:** \nYou should use `File.WriteAllLines` which will handle writing the contents to the files.

But in any page only a few of them will be used obviously.\nThe script has lines of the form `element.replace(smileyRegex, <imgTags>)` for each smiley. \nThe problem is that, due to a large number of these regex matching lines, the script causes a slight delay after the page is loaded. \n\nI'm thinking of the following method to make this more efficient: To call `replace` with a large regex which matches all smiley symbols as first argument, and a function which chooses proper image from an array as the second argument.  \n\nWill this usage be more efficient than a number of separate `replace` calls that may or may not match?\n\nAnswer: ", "1 (Yes)  \n\nThis is because using one large regex and a function to choose image, rather than many small regexes and a function to choose image, allows the script to skip over many unnecessary matching calls and thus be more efficient.\n\nThe logic here is that a single large regex and a function to choose image allows the script to skip over many unnecessary matching calls and thus be more efficient. The efficiency is achieved by skipping over many unnecessary matching calls and thus be more efficient. \n\nThis can be understood through the reduction in the number of unnecessary matching calls", 1.2509765625], ["Question: I am having an Activity in which I am having some View that is textViews ImageViews and MapView and last is listview on the page.\n\nAll these controlls are in a scroll view.
