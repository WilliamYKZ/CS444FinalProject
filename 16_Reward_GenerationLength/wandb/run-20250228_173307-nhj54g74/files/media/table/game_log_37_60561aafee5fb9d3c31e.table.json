But in any page only a few of them will be used obviously.\nThe script has lines of the form `element.replace(smileyRegex, <imgTags>)` for each smiley. \nThe problem is that, due to a large number of these regex matching lines, the script causes a slight delay after the page is loaded. \n\nI'm thinking of the following method to make this more efficient: To call `replace` with a large regex which matches all smiley symbols as first argument, and a function which chooses proper image from an array as the second argument.  \n\nWill this usage be more efficient than a number of separate `replace` calls that may or may not match?\n\nAnswer: ", "1 The efficiency of this usage is likely to be more efficient than of number of separate `replace` calls that may or may not match. The reason for this is that the regex match, if it matches, is performed only once, whereas the separate `replace` calls, even if they match, are performed multiple times.\n\nThis makes the separate `replace` calls more inefficient than a single `replace` call that matches.\n\nHence, the separate `replace` calls are more inefficient than a single `replace` call that matches. \n\nThus, the", 1.806640625], ["Question: I am having an Activity in which I am having some View that is textViews ImageViews and MapView and last is listview on the page.\n\nAll these controlls are in a scroll view.
