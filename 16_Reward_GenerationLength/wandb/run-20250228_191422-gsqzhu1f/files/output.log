Some weights of Qwen2ForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /home/exouser/Desktop/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and are newly initialized: ['score.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

0it [00:00, ?it/s]You're using a Qwen2TokenizerFast tokenizer. Please note that with a fast tokenizer, using the `__call__` method is faster than using a method to encode the text followed by a call to the `pad` method to get a padded encoding.
