For example, `Foo` has 4 values, `a, b, c, d` that, range from `0 to 3`. Usually I don't care, but sometimes, those structures are \n\n1. used in a tight loop;\n2. their values are read a billion times/s, and that is **the** bottleneck of the program;\n3. the whole program consists of a big array of billions of `Foo`s;\n\nIn that case, I find myself having trouble deciding how to represent `Foo` efficiently. I have basically 4 options:\n\n```\nstruct Foo {\n    int a;\n    int b;\n    int c;\n    int d;\n};\n\nstruct Foo {\n    char a;\n    char b;\n    char c;\n    char d;\n};\n\nstruct Foo {\n    char abcd;\n};\n\nstruct FourFoos {\n    int abcd_abcd_abcd_abcd;\n};\n\n```\n\nThey use 128, 32, 8, 8 bits respectively per `Foo`, ranging from sparse to densely packed. The first example is probably the most linguistic one, but using it would essentially increase by 16 times the size of the program, which doesn't sound quite right. Moreover, most of the memory will be filled with zeroes and not be used at all, which makes me wonder if this isn't a waste.

I would need the number of `.bar`in the actual `.foo`but have no idea how to access them.\n\nAnswer: ", "0\n\nTo achieve this, I need to find out the number of same divs for the parent of a button.\n\nYour task is to find out the number of same divs for the parent of a button.\n\nExplanation: This problem has been asked on various occasions. The issue with the given code is that it is trying to access the length of the parent which is actually the length of the child. To solve this, we need to properly listen to the button click event. We can achieve this by using jQuery's `eventListener`. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. Wrap the document in jQuery to ensure proper functionality.\n2. Listen for the `click` event on the element with the class `countthem`.\n3. When the event is triggered, get the length of the parent element which is the length of the child and display it.\n\nHere is the complete solution:\n\n```javascript\n$(document).on(\"click\", '.countthem', function() {\n  var n = $(this).parent('.foo').children('.bar').length;\n  $(\".number\").text(\"There are \" + n + \" divs.\");\n});\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. This solution works as follows:\n\n1. We wrap the document in jQuery to ensure proper functionality.\n2. We listen for the `click` event on the element with the class `countthem`.\n3. When the event is triggered, we get the length of the parent which is the length of the child and display it.\n\nThis solution was implemented by carefully listening to the `click` event on the element with the class `countthem`. By using jQuery's `eventListener`, we can properly listen to the `click` event to get the length of the parent is actually of the child and display it.\n\nThe answer is 0.\n```\n\nThis solution works because it listens to the `click` event on the element with the class `countthem` and gets the length of the parent, which is actually the length of the child. It then displays this information in the element with the class `number`. The explanation is that this solution works as expected, displaying the correct number of divs.\n\nThe answer is \\boxed{0}\n```\n``\n\nThis solution correctly counts the number of divs for the parent of a button.\n\nLet's write the code to implement this solution.\n```javascript\n$(document).on(\"click\", '.countthem', function() {\n  var n = $(this).parent('.foo').children('.bar').length;\n  $(\".number\").text(\"There are \" + n + \" divs\");\n});\n```\n```html\n<script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://example.com/js/number.js\"></script>\n<div class=\"", -0.461669921875], ["Question: I've noticed `.git/log` while searching where git saves stash commits.
