In File A, call C:\\temp\\B.vbs\n\nWherever folder I put these vbs files, as long as they are on the same folder, file A should call file B without changing the code. How can I do this in VBScript?\n\nAnswer: ", "3\n\nTo make sure that when these vbs files are placed, as long as they are in the same folder, file A should call file B without modifying the code, you can use the \"Invoke\" property in VBScript. The \"Invoke\" property allows you to specify the script to be executed.\n\nHere is how you can do this in VBScript:\n\n```vbs\nSet objShell = WScript.CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\")\nobjShell.Run (objShell.ExpandEnvironmentString & \"\\foldername\\filename.vbs\")\n```\n\nIn this code, the `ExpandEnvironmentString` property will be used to expand the environment string, which is the folder where the scripts are located. Then, the `Run` method will be used to run the script.\n\nNote: You should take care that the paths are correct and the scripts are compatible to be run together.\n\nYou can also use other methods, such as using the `CreateObject` method to create a process and execute the script. The advantage of this method is that you can control more the execution, but it may be more complex to manage.\n\nHope this helps!

Also i will take the XY Problem into account next time :D.***\n\nAnswer: ", "5/10/213 0227\n\n(Keep doing my code review) It seems like the issue is related to the formatting of the string you're trying to parse. You're attempting to parse a datetime string in the format `dd/MM/yyyy HHmmss` which includes both date and time components. The `ParseExact` method in C# requires the format to be explicitly set. The format string should match the exact pattern of your input string.\n\nYou can use the `TryParseExact` method to parse the string and handle the exception gracefully. This method attempts to parse the string but if the parsing fails, it doesn't throw an exception. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```csharp\nDateTime stt;\nif(DateTime.TryParseExact(stt, \"dd/MM/yyyy HHmmss\", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture))\n{\n    DateTime result = DateTime.ParseExact(stt, \"dd/MM/yyyy HHssss\", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);\n    // Your code here\n}\nelse{\n    // Your code here for handling the exception\n}\n\nThis approach avoids the exception and allows the code to continue executing. You can then deal with the situation where the parsing failed.\n\nAnswer 5/10/213 227 (This also works if you handle the parsing failure gracefully).\n\nLet's go ahead and handle it gracefully in C#.\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        string dateString = \"5/10/213 027\"; // This is the string you want to parse.\n        string format = \"dd/MM/yy HHssss\";\n        \n        DateTime parsedDate;\n        \n        if(DateTime.TryParseExact(parsedDate, dateString, NumberStyles.Anything)){\n            // This part of the code will execute if the parsing is successful.\n        }\n        else{\n            Console.WriteLine(\"The string is not recognized as a valid DateTime.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis way, the code will continue to execute and you can deal with the situation where the parsing failed.

To get a consistent count without running 2 separate queries, you can use a combination of `COUNT(DISTINCT user)` at the beginning of your query and then using `SKIP` and `LIMIT`.
