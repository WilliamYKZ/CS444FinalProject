The explanation for the behavior you're observing in the C# code lies in how integer overflow works in this language.\n\nThe key point is that when you perform the `++` operation on an integer, the value is not updated directly. Instead, a new integer is created with the updated value. The old value is not retained.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of what happens in each line:\n\n1. `int a = 0; int b = 5;`\n   Here, we initialize `a` to 0 and `b` to 5. Both variables are integers.\n\n2. `a = b++`\n   In this line, after `b++`, `b` is incremented by 1. However, the value of `b` is not updated immediately. This means `b` retains its current value, which is 5.\n\n3. `a = b++`\n   Similarly, in this line, after `b++`, `b` is incremented by 1, however, the value of `b` is not updated immediately. \n\n4. `a = b++`\n   In this line, after `b++`, `b` is incremented by 1", -0.48291015625], ["Question: I was scoping out an iPhone app project and wanted to know from some iPhone App veterans how long it might take a build a simple dictionary app.\n\nIt would contain the following views: search, definition and favorites.
