When I click the button to \"show modal\" the modal loads however the body of the dialog doesn't fill it's space properly, and the toolbar is mashed up against it. Upon resize everything jumps back into place nicely.\n\nI'm looking for a clean fix, so far I figure a hacky fix might be to load the modal with a zIndex that puts it behind the page body, and alter the z-index via CSS with the button click (but this seems really hackish). I could probably also programatically resize the modal after the button fires modal.show() but that would cause a visible jump in the layout which I would like to avoid.\n\nAny suggestions? I know AlloyUI has tons of hidden goodies, as their documentation is sparse, perhaps the visible attribute is not the one I should be using?\n\nAnswer: ", "1. Using the visible attribute is a common practice, but it sounds like you're looking for a more custom solution. The question you have is around the \"AlloyUI modal 'Real World Example'\" from their website. It looks like you are encountering issues with the visibility and positioning of the modal after resizing the page. Here are some suggestions to solve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure the Modal's Z-Index is Correct**:\n   - You can add a `z-index` property to the modal element to ensure it stays above the body in the DOM hierarchy. This will make sure the modal remains on top even after the body is resized.\n\n2. **Use JavaScript to Toggle Visibility and Position the Modal**: \n   - You can use JavaScript to toggle the modal's visibility and position it after the button click. This approach avoids the visible jump by altering the visibility state programmatically.\n\n3. **Modify CSS to Ensure Proper Post-Resize Positioning**: \n   - You can use CSS to alter the modal's visibility and position it after the button click. This ensures the modal stays on top even after the page is resized.\n\nGiven the constraints, here is a mix of both approaches, the most straight forward and clean solution seems to be to use JavaScript to toggle the modal's visibility and position it after the button click, as this will avoid the visible jump issue.\n\nHere is a mix of both approaches, the most straight forward and clean solution seems to be to use JavaScript to toggle the modal's visibility and position it after the button click.\n```javascript\n// Initialize the modal\nvar modal = document.getElementById('modal');\n\n// Add a class to the modal to keep it above the body in the DOM hierarchy\nmodal.classList.add('above-body');\n\n// Function to toggle the modal's visibility and position it after the button click\nfunction toggleModalClick() {\n  // Toggle the modal's visibility\n  modal.style.visibility = !modal;\n\n  // Position the modal after the button click\n  if (!modal) {\n    // Use JavaScript to toggle and position the modal after the button click\n  var modal = document.getElementById('modal');\n  modal.style.position = 'absolute';\n  modal.style.left = '50px'; // Adjust the left based on your need\n}\n```\nThe most straight forward and clean solution, considering the constraints of the problem and the given context, is to use JavaScript to toggle the modal's visibility and position it after the button click. This avoids the visible jump issue by modifying the visibility state programmatically, ensuring the modal stays on top after the page is resized.\n\nThis solution aligns with the provided code snippet by ensuring the modal stays on top after the page is resized.
