When I click the button to \"show modal\" the modal loads however the body of the dialog doesn't fill it's space properly, and the toolbar is mashed up against it. Upon resize everything jumps back into place nicely.\n\nI'm looking for a clean fix, so far I figure a hacky fix might be to load the modal with a zIndex that puts it behind the page body, and alter the z-index via CSS with the button click (but this seems really hackish). I could probably also programatically resize the modal after the button fires modal.show() but that would cause a visible jump in the layout which I would like to avoid.\n\nAny suggestions? I know AlloyUI has tons of hidden goodies, as their documentation is sparse, perhaps the visible attribute is not the one I should be using?\n\nAnswer: ", "1 The issue you're facing is indeed caused by how the `visible` attribute works in the context of dynamically loading a modal. When you set `visible: true`, it initially makes the modal visible, but it doesn't prevent the modal from being visible once it loads. When you change it to `visible: false`, it hides the modal from being visible upon initial load, but the modal still appears once you trigger the visibility change event. To ensure the modal does not appear on load and remains hidden until you explicitly show it, you can use JavaScript to set the `z-index`", 0.7353515625], ["Question: Could somebody help me complete this linq left outer join query so that the second column of the right table (tempData) is contained in the result set even though it may be null?\n\n```\nsortedData = From cs In mbCustomSort\n             Order By cs(0)\n             Group Join entry In tempData On cs(joinColumn) Equals entry(0) Into Group\n             From last In Group.DefaultIfEmpty _\n             Select New With {.groupField = cs(joinColumn)}\n\n```\n\nAnswer: ", "1\n\nThis LINQ query attempts to group by the second column of the right table `tempData` and includes the first occurrence of the column in the result set, even though it may be null.
