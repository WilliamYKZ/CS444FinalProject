You should ensure that you're providing the content you want to write to the files. In your code, you are using `StreamWriter` to write content to the files.

But in any page only a few of them will be used obviously.\nThe script has lines of the form `element.replace(smileyRegex, <imgTags>)` for each smiley. \nThe problem is that, due to a large number of these regex matching lines, the script causes a slight delay after the page is loaded. \n\nI'm thinking of the following method to make this more efficient: To call `replace` with a large regex which matches all smiley symbols as first argument, and a function which chooses proper image from an array as the second argument.  \n\nWill this usage be more efficient than a number of separate `replace` calls that may or may not match?\n\nAnswer: ", "1 The usage will likely be less efficient than a number of separate `replace` calls that may or may not match. This is because of the principle that a larger number of regexes that may or may not match is not as efficient as fewer regexes that may or may not match. Thus, a larger number of `replace` calls that may or may not match is not as efficient as fewer `replace` calls that may or may not match.\n\nTo make this more efficient, calling `replace` with a large regex which matches all smiley symbols", 1.0732421875], ["Question: I am having an Activity in which I am having some View that is textViews ImageViews and MapView and last is listview on the page.\n\nAll these controlls are in a scroll view.

This can be due to the way the `ListView` is being scrolled. \n\nTo address this, you may want to consider the following alternatives:\n\n- **Alternative 1:** Use a different approach such as setting the `ListView`'s `focusable` to `false`. This can be done by adding `ListView.setFocusable(false)`.\n\n- **Alternative 2:** Implement", 4.6015625], ["Question: I have an image URL in a `imageUrl` variable and I am trying to set it as CSS style, using jQuery:\n\n```\n$('myObject').css('background-image', imageUrl);\n\n```\n\nThis seems to be not working, as:\n\n```\nconsole.log($('myObject').css('background-image'));\n\n```\n\nreturns `none`.\n\nAny idea, what I am doing wrong?\n\nAnswer: ", "1\nThe issue you are facing is indeed due to the way you are setting the background image. The method you are using to set the background image is correct, but the way you are checking it is incorrect. You should be using the method to check the background image.\n\nIn jQuery, when you set the background image using `css('background-image', imageUrl)` the background image is correctly set.
