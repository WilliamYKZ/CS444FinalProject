But in any page only a few of them will be used obviously.\nThe script has lines of the form `element.replace(smileyRegex, <imgTags>)` for each smiley. \nThe problem is that, due to a large number of these regex matching lines, the script causes a slight delay after the page is loaded. \n\nI'm thinking of the following method to make this more efficient: To call `replace` with a large regex which matches all smiley symbols as first argument, and a function which chooses proper image from an array as the second argument.  \n\nWill this usage be more efficient than a number of separate `replace` calls that may or may not match?\n\nAnswer: ", "1 The usage will likely be more efficient than a number of separate `replace` calls that may or may not match.
