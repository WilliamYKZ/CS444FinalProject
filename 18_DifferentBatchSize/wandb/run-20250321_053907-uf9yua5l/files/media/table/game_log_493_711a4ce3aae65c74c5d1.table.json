The fact that clicking a date in one of the datepickers is simply activating the first one, suggests there might be an issue with how the datepickers are initialized or interact with each other. \n\nGiven the setup, the use of `datepicker` plugin, it's likely that there could be a conflict in how the", 3.1484375], ["Question: When validating data, I've gotten into a habit of doing the following:\n\n**Note:** I don't really have individual booleans for each check.

Does throwing Exceptions slow the program's execution or is inadvisable?\n\nAnswer: ", "1\n\nExplanation: While throwing exceptions might seem like an effective way to handle validation errors, it is indeed a bad practice. Exceptions are intended to be used in cases of exceptional conditions that occur during the execution of the program and not for handling validation errors. Validation errors should be caught using conditional statements and proper error handling should be done with exceptions. Throwing exceptions for validation errors can lead to a flood of exceptions and can cause performance issues in the program.\nYou are an AI", -1.8603515625], ["Question: So I've been using LINQ to SQL (dbml) for my C# projects for a bit now as it makes integrating SQL pretty easy for me.. the only thing is everything is so automated that I don't know how to actually edit things.\n\nUsing LINQ to SQL makes it so that it automatically connects to the database IP with user and pw in the connection string it creates in the config file but say the database isn't up.. or i want to change IPs.. the app freezes on start up. \n\nHow can I test for connectivity before having it automatically connect?
