E.g. in GNU Bash version 4.3.11:\n\n```none\n$ ls -l\ntotal 0\n$ touch 1 2; mv -f 1 2; ls\n2\n$ touch 1 2; mv 1 2; ls\n2\n\n```\n\nIt seems unlikely the intention of the `-f` flag is to override `alias mv=\"mv -i\"`, because there are [several standard ways](https://stackoverflow.com/q/6162903/82216) of overriding an alias (e.g. using `\\mv`) that would do this more concisely and in a way that is consistent across commands.\n\nThe manual notes that, \"If you specify more than one of the -i, -f, -n options, only the final one takes effect,\" but it still seems unlikely the intention of the `-f` flag is to override the `-i` flag in general, because equivalent behaviour can be achieved by simply using `mv`, which is much more concise and comprehensible than using `mv -if`.\n\nThat being the case, what is the purpose of the `-f` flag? Why does it exist?\n\nAnswer: ", " The `-f` flag exists due to historical idiosyncrasies where the `-f` flag was included as an additional option, but its purpose seems to be redundant in modern versions of `bash`.
