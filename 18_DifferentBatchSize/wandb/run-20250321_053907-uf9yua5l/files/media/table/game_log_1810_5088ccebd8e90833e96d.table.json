This is a real phenomenon in nature, where certain organisms emit light without an external source of energy. Your character's iris cells could have a similar ability to produce light, which would cause them to glow when excited.\n\n2) Emotional response: When your character feels emotions such as anger, fear, or love, it would trigger this bioluminescent reaction.

So with `save_main_session` set to `False`, if my `DoFn` in the `process` method uses for example standard lib `copy` module, Beam's `FileSystems` API or my custom module, if I import those at the module level (top of the file) in which the `DoFn` is defined, this would fail in Dataflow service with an error that says that `copy` (etc) module was not found from the `process` method (which all makes sense), and I could fix this by either:\n\n1. importing `copy` inside the process method\n2. \"saving\" `copy` reference/object as a field/provider/etc in the `DoFn` instance\n3. setting `save_main_session` to `True`\n\nI don't want to set `save_main_session` to `True` because afaiu it captures whole main session and I have bunch of objects that are not serializable in there, and overall find `save_main_session` to be smelly and hacky. 1st option is kinda smelly as well and doesn't always work - tho imports are cached so performance wise should be okish - but it would not work for my custom modules afaiu (unless I explicitly install/send them over to the workers).
