Your issue might be due to the changes in how Android 9 (Pie) handles external storage. Starting from Android 9, Google introduced a new concept called Scoped Storage which changes the way apps access the external storage.

Here is a solution that you can try:

1. First, make sure you have the necessary permissions in your manifest file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```
Note: If your target SDK is 29 (Android 10) or above, you also need to add this line in your manifest file inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"
```

2. Use the `getExternalFilesDir()` method instead of `getExternalStoragePublicDirectory()`. The latter is deprecated in API 29 and above. 

Here is the code for getting the Download directory:

```kotlin
val dir = context.getExternalFilesDir(Environment.DIRECTORY_DOWNLOADS)?.absolutePath
```
The `getExternalFilesDir()` method returns the path to files folder inside Android/data/your.package.name/files/ on the external storage, which is private to your app. The advantage of using this directory is that you don't require any permissions and Android will take care of the cleanup when the app is uninstalled.

Remember, starting from Android 11 (API 30), apps cannot access other app's external storage directories. You can only access your own app's external storage directory.
