The issue here seems to be the incorrect class reference in your XML file. The error message `ClassNotFoundException: android.preference.ListViewPreference` indicates that the system is trying to find your custom `ListViewPreference` class in the `android.preference` package, but it's not there.

In your XML file, you're using `custom:ListViewPreference` to reference your custom preference class. However, it seems like the system is not recognizing `custom` as your custom namespace that you've defined at the top of the file.

Try using the full class name, including the package, in your XML file. So, replace:

```xml
<custom:ListViewPreference
    android:id="@+id/font_selector"
    android:key="font"
    android:title="Font"
    android:summary="Edit Font" />
```

With:

```xml
<com.example.ebookreader.ListViewPreference
    android:id="@+id/font_selector"
    android:key="font"
    android:title="Font"
    android:summary="Edit Font" />
```

This way, the system should be able to find your custom `ListViewPreference` class in the correct package.
