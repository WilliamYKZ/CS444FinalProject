To solve your problem, you can use the following approach:

1. Parse the HTML of the page.
2. Find all the heading elements (`h2`, `h3`, `h4` etc.) in the parsed HTML.
3. Loop through each heading element. For each heading element, find the `li` elements that follow it until the next heading element is encountered.

Here is a sample Python code that uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and implement the above approach:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

url = "https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/1._Januar"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Find all h2, h3, h4 elements
headers = soup.select("#toc ~ h2, #toc ~ h3, #toc ~ h4")

for i in range(len(headers) - 1):
    start = headers[i]
    end = headers[i+1]

    # Find all li elements between start and end
    lis = []
    sibling = start.find_next_sibling()
    while sibling != end:
        if sibling.name == "li":
            lis.append(sibling)
        sibling = sibling.find_next_sibling()

    # Process lis
    # ...
```

In the above code, `soup.select("#toc ~ h2, #toc ~ h3, #toc ~ h4")` is used to select all `h2`, `h3`, `h4` elements that follow the `#toc` element in the HTML. Then, for each pair of consecutive headers, it finds all `li` elements between them by iterating over the siblings of the first header until the second header is reached.

You can replace the `#...` line with the processing you want to do with the `li` elements.

Please note that this code is in Python, not VBA. However, the approach should be applicable in VBA as well. You just need to use a library that can parse HTML and make HTTP requests, and translate the Python code into VBA code.
