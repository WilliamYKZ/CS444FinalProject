This Java code is for an Address Book application. Here's a quick summary of what it does:

1. In the constructor `AddressBookApp()`, it sets up a simple GUI for the application. It creates a JFrame and a JPanel with various components like text fields for name, number, mobile and address, and buttons for adding, deleting, navigating through contacts, and clearing the fields. It also sets up a menu bar with options to import, export, and exit the application.

2. The `main` method simply creates an instance of the AddressBookApp, which launches the application.

3. The `actionPerformed` method handles the actions taken by the user. If the user chooses to exit, it will close the application. If the user chooses to import or export, it will call the corresponding methods. If the user clicks the next or previous buttons, it will navigate to the next or previous contact.

4. The `importContacts` method reads contact details from a file and stores them in lists.

5. The `exportContacts` method writes the current contact details to a file.

6. The `nextContact` and `prevContact` methods navigate to the next or previous contact in the list and display their details in the text fields.

Please note that there are a few issues with the code: 

- There are no event listeners added to the add, delete, and export buttons. 
- The variable `index` is not declared anywhere in the provided code. 
- The lists `name`, `phone`, `mobile`, `address`, and `details` are also not declared.
- The `importContacts` method is called at the end of `nextContact` and `prevContact` methods which might lead to re-importing the data every time these methods are called.

These issues need to be fixed for the application to work correctly.
