This is particularly useful when you want to include CSS within a `<style>` tag or directly in the `<head>` section of an HTML document.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this is done:\n\n1. **Preventing HTML Interpretation**: When you place CSS inside a `<style>` tag, it is meant to be interpreted as CSS, not as HTML. If you don't enclose it in `<!-- -->`, the browser might interpret the CSS as HTML, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.\n\n2. **Consistency", -1.111328125], ["Question: I'm trying to run a macro that will delete rows that don't contain a particular value in column B.

Here are some common reasons and explanations:\n\n### 1. **Commenting the CSS Block**\n   - **Purpose**: This allows you to comment out the entire CSS block without affecting the HTML structure.\n   - **Example**:\n     ```html\n     <!--\n     <style type=\"text/css\">\n     .class {\n         color: red;\n     }\n     </style>\n     -->\n     ```\n     If you want to temporarily disable the styles, you can simply remove the `<!--` and `-->` tags.\n\n### 2. **Preventing Parsing Issues**\n   - **Purpose**: Some browsers or environments might have issues with parsing certain characters within a CSS block directly.\n   - **Example**:\n     ```html\n     <style type=\"text/css\">\n     .class {\n         color: red;\n     }\n     </style>\n     ```\n     If there are special characters or syntax that might cause parsing issues, wrapping it in `<!-- -->` can help.\n\n### 3. **Ensuring Proper Formatting**\n   - **Purpose**: It ensures that the CSS block is properly formatted and visually separated from other content.\n   - **Example**:\n     ```html\n     <style type=\"text/css\">\n     .class {\n         color: red;\n     }\n     </style>\n     ```\n     This makes it easier to read and maintain the CSS code.\n\n### 4. **Avoiding Syntax Errors**\n   - **Purpose**: Ensures that the CSS block is correctly interpreted by the browser.\n   - **Example**:\n     ```html\n     <style type=\"text/css\">\n     .class {\n         color: red;\n     }\n     </style>\n     ```\n     Wrapping it in `<!-- -->` can prevent any potential syntax errors that might occur if the CSS block is not properly formatted.\n\n### 5. **Consistency Across Different Environments**\n   - **Purpose**: Maintains consistency across different environments where the CSS might be included.\n   - **Example**:\n     ```html\n     <!--\n     <style type=\"text/css\">\n     .class {\n         color: red;\n     }\n     </style>\n     -->\n     ```\n     This ensures", -7.2421875], ["Question: I am using video.js (<http://www.videojs.com/>) to build a video approval system and need to log user actions in the player. I can do this easily enough with play, pause, end etc. but have hit a problem when trying to log seeks.\n\nI want to be able to log the start and end times of any seeks within the plaback, so we know if the user has not actually watched a section of the video. The player seems to offer events to support this, but I am struggling to get correct timings from it.\n\nWhen the user skips through a video the player emits the following events in order: pause, seeking, seeked, play.\n\nIf I query the player object at any of these events using currentTime() the result is always the end time for the seek, even on the initial pause event. This means I can log where the seek ended but not where it started.\n\nCan anyone help me to find the position in the video where the seek begins?\n\nIf this is not possible, I'd settle for a way to disable seeking during playback.\n\nEDIT: adding code as requested. It's pretty simple:\n\n```\nvar trackedPlayer = videojs('pvp-player');\n\ntrackedPlayer.on(\"play\", function (e) {\n    console.log(\"Video playback started: \" + trackedPlayer.currentTime());\n});\n\ntrackedPlayer.on(\"pause\", function (e) {\n    console.log(\"Video playback paused: \" + trackedPlayer.currentTime());\n});\n\ntrackedPlayer.on(\"seeking\", function (e) {\n    console.log(\"Video seeking: \" + trackedPlayer.currentTime());\n});\n\ntrackedPlayer.on(\"seeked\", function (e) {\n    console.log(\"Video seek ended: \" + trackedPlayer.currentTime());\n});\n\ntrackedPlayer.on(\"ended\", function (e) {\n    console.log(\"Video playback ended.\");\n});\n\n```\n\nIf I can get all the tracking I want I will replace console.log with ajax calls to store the data.\n\nAnswer: ", "1. To track the start and end times of seeks in Video.js, you can use the `seeking` and `seeked` events to capture the seek start and end times respectively. However, as you've observed, the `currentTime()` method returns the end time of the seek, not the start time. \n\nTo get the start time of the seek, you can store the current time before the seek starts and then use that stored value when the seek ends. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```javascript\nvar trackedPlayer = videojs('pvp-player');\nvar startTime;\n\ntrackedPlayer.on(\"play\", function (e) {\n    console.log(\"Video playback started: \" + trackedPlayer.currentTime());\n});\n\ntrackedPlayer.on(\"pause\", function (e) {\n    console.log(\"Video playback paused: \" + trackedPlayer.currentTime());\n});\n\ntrackedPlayer.on(\"seeking\", function (e) {\n    // Store the current time before the seek starts\n    startTime = trackedPlayer.currentTime();\n    console.log(\"Video seeking: \" + startTime);\n});\n\ntrackedPlayer.on(\"seeked\", function (e) {\n    // Log the end time of the seek\n    console.log(\"Video seek ended: \" + trackedPlayer.currentTime());\n    // Log the start time of the seek\n    console.log(\"Video seek start: \" + startTime);\n});\n\ntrackedPlayer.on(\"ended\", function (e) {\n    console.log(\"Video playback ended.\");\n});\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `startTime` is a variable that stores the current time before the seek starts.\n- When the `seeking` event is triggered, the current time is stored in `startTime`.\n- When the `seeked` event is triggered, both the end time of the seek (`trackedPlayer.currentTime()`) and the start time (`startTime`) are logged.\n\nThis approach ensures that you have both the start and end times of each seek.\n\n2. If you want to disable seeking during playback, you can use the `seeking` event to prevent further seeks. You can do this by setting the `currentTime` to the current time whenever the `seeking` event is triggered:\n\n```javascript\ntrackedPlayer.on(\"play\", function (e) {\n    console.log(\"Video playback started: \" + trackedPlayer.currentTime());\n", -3.048828125], ["Question: \u041a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \"\u0422\u044b \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b \u043e\u043f\u044f\u0442\u0430?\" \u0438\u043b\u0438 \"\u0422\u044b \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b \u043e\u043f\u044f\u0442?\". \u0415\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0435-\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e \u0443\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0442\u043e\u043c \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435?\n\nAnswer: ", "!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", -0.84033203125], ["Question: I am using Omniauth in a Rails application for login, my omniauth.rb, is as show below:\n\n```\nOmniAuth.config.logger = Rails.logger\n\nRails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\n   provider :facebook, 'xxxxxxx', 'xxxxxxx'\n   provider :google_oauth2, 'xxxxxxxxx','xxxxxxxx'\nend\n\n```\n\nWhen a user attempts to login (via Facebook or Goolge) and denies permissions, get the following error:\n\n```\n OmniAuth::Strategies::OAuth2::CallbackError \n\n```\n\nwith this parameters:\n\n```\n{\"error\"=>\"access_denied\",\n \"error_code\"=>\"200\",\n \"error_description\"=>\"Permissions error\",\n \"error_reason\"=>\"user_denied\",\n \"state\"=>\"60daee5f78d9cc28972050ae8ca8f950bb4ed5958302bcea\"}\n\n```\n\nif the user accept, no problem and everything works fine.\n\nI've tried some of the possible solutions related with this error, and listed on this website, but none solved my problem.
