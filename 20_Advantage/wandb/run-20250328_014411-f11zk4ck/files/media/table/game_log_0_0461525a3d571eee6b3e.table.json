In C++, arrays are passed by reference, but they cannot be passed as a single argument like a pointer to a string.

When a creature dies, its body decomposes and loses its ability to communicate. This is why skeletons, which are the remains of once-living creatures, cannot speak.

No, you cannot directly pass a string array (or any other array type) by value to a function in C++. The reason is that arrays are not passed by value in C++, they are passed by reference. When you pass an array to a function, a copy of the pointer to the first element of the array is made, but the actual array itself is not copied.

In your case, the issue seems to be related to how you are using `Application.WorksheetFunction.Search` and `IsNumber`. The `Search` function returns a `Long` value if found, or `False` if not found.
